2,Self-Sustainable Communities,"Over the past few years, I've been learning a little bit about degraded lands and how to bring them back to usable land again, permaculture and food forests, also mushroom farms, and how to use mycelium to create building material for housing. 

It really seems that there are solutions to live much better and to even help with climate change. More and more people are taking a more sustainable way of living, but if we're not in net 0 in CO2 production, then we're not much better than someone who produces more than us (at least in my opinion but I do see the other side of the argument). 

Just imagine going from a degraded land to a food-rich forest with animals and off-grid communities, where a new generation will be raised in working with the land to benefit everybody. There are plenty of permaculture and food forest communities that I came across but it's nowhere near as many we should have to change the way people live or just change the perspective on what is actually possible. Usually, it would be in the government's hands to start some big-scale projects of some sort like China did in a few cases. What would be the alternative way? How can something like this be profitable even after the initial increase of property value so that big investors can be lured in or for anyone who wants to start something like this?",sustainability,1646009146

67,Some Economic Principles of Post-Scarcity,"Hi there.

So, I know, you've heard it all before. All this talk about how post scarcity is right around the corner, yay futurism, no need to worry about sustainability!

However, in my view, and quite logically in fact, sustainability actually is maybe one if the things that is key to humanity attaining abundance. Think about the circular economy for second. If we are able to manage our resources in such a way so that while their amount was still obviously finite, but the *longevity* of a resource's utility were indefinite, by which I mean that resource which have utility are always going to be available (as would be closer to reality in a circular economic context), then we would have achieved relative abundance for that given resource.

Then there's the consideration of energy Vs resource efficiency. We can use many sustainable methods to just generate more energy, the same cannot be said for rarer physical resources.

I actually talk about this further [here](https://youtu.be/U6wEI9KNOJw). Nevertheless, I definitely do think that sustainability and the pursuit of abundance are very closely linked.",sustainability,1645480428

There's lot's of different things I potentially want to do with it, but initially I'll probably focus on stickers to get my feet wet. Both with those, and with other stuff in the future, I want to make sure I'm being as sustainable as possible. I have some ideas and a couple questions, and I was hoping you guys might have suggestions if I've missed anything. 

* Firstly, I'll be using USPS.
* I want to incorporate recycled (by me) paper whenever possible since I save my paper products to recycle/upcycle. Stuff like if I ever need packing-stuffing I can use shredded paper, and making my own handmade cardstock and paper for stuff like envelopes, etc.  I'll have a cricut so I'm thinking I should be able to use that to cut homemade recycled paper into whatever shapes I need. Which brings me to:
* If I make my own envelopes, how do I make sure they're fully recyclable/compostable with the glue I use (side question: is paper actually compostable, or just recyclable?) -- basically, what's a good glue, either homemade or store-bought, that won't ruin the whole thing?
* On a similar note -- if I need to ship things in a cardboard box in the future (that would be okay, right? Does any cardboard box work, or should I be looking specifically for ones that are advertised as compostable or recyclable?), I think it would be cute to have a little ""please compost/recycle me!"" stamp (or sticker). What would be the best way to do that? I'm assuming not all inks are compostable/recyclable (sorry for saying those so many times, I'm just unsure on which one it'll end up being), right? So should I look for a vegan ink pad and use a custom stamp? Is printer ink recyclable? Then I would be able to make my own (non-vinyl) sticker for it. Let me know what you guys think is best, but my gut instinct is telling me a simple rubber stamp and a vegan ink pad would be best. 
* I saw someone mention paper tape. I did a brief google search and saw a bunch of different options. Is all paper tape recyclable or compostable, or again should I be looking for something specific?
* For any of you that have your own Etsy shop, what are some of *your* sustainable go-to's?

That's all I have at the moment, but please let me know if I've missed something! Thank you all in advance, you're awesome :)",sustainability,1645098825

55,"Sustainability: Education, Careers, and the Job Market: Grad Student Perspective","I'd like to have a discussion with other students and sustainability professionals about the difficulty finding a job in such a broad category. But first, let me just give you guys some more background on me. In the spring of 2020, I graduated with a BS degree in aerospace engineering with a very poor GPA around 2.6/4.0. Once junior year hit, I struggled to find motivation knowing the vast majority of my jobs would be with defense contracts: Something I am absolutely against. Perhaps the biggest trigger for my anxieties was the uncertainty of my graduation due to poor grades, but I made it through it with the help of family, friends, and prozac. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally felt like I was getting a break and was actually kind of happy for the shutdowns since it meant I didn't have to stress about loans and finding a job. Eventually the novelty faded and boredom set in. Luckily, I was able to find motivation in myself since I at least had a degree now. So I put that to the job search, which I'm sure many people can agree is an absolute clusterfuck *especially* during the pandemic. It brought back lots of the same feelings I had during my undergrad, but less severe. After applying to hundreds of jobs and being unable to get a single positive response, I gave up deciding to instead try and pivot career paths. 

&amp;#x200B;

After doing lots of research on how to do that, I decided going back to school to get an MS was my best bet. Most of my friends were going back, the job market sucked, and most importantly; My undegrad university gave the class of 2020 half off tuition for grad school. Now I am in my last semester of an Engineering Management degree with a focus on strategic sustainability management/sustainability driven enterprise. I know it was the right decision because I am a ton happier in this program because it is doing something that interests me without the guilt of working for the military industrial complex. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that y'all understand some of my background, I have compiled a bunch of the things I learned trying to pivot and find a career in sustainability.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Sustainability vs Environment** \- These are both words used a ton in job descriptions, often interchangeably. They are not. Sustainability simply means to make something last as long as possible. It will show up on everything from corporate executive to minimum wage descriptions (the latter being antithetical to sustainability). Environment is similar, but tends to be used for more technical positions relating to environmental health and safety or engineering positions. Both make horrible search terms. 
2. **Learn Search Terms that Suite your Interests** \- Start by looking at companies that do something that interests you, even if it isn't sustainability related. Look up 'CompanyName Annual Report' and search for sustainability with ctrl+f. If they don't have a section dedicated to it, they probably aren't a company for you. If they are, google their name and add sustainability report or Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This will give you a more in depth idea of what a career in sustainability there might look like as well as if they're bullshitting you. More importantly, this will help develop your vocabulary providing you with new search terms. Use those terms on job sites and continue to note what their descriptions use. E.g. LEED, ESG, Emissions, GRI etc.
3. **Location Matters** \- I'm US based and the amount of jobs and pay vary wildly between states as a result of state-level regulations. California has a carbon trading system, so there will be a ton of jobs there for it. NY has very strong environmental regulations and is the birthplace of many social movements in the country. A place like Florida will have less given its abysmal gubernatorial record. That's not to say none because they are at heavy risks to the effects of climate change. Moreover, regionality between municipal, state, and national governing bodies all play into the job market at any given location. 
4. **Company Matters** \- Same as the last point, but it is driven by private investments. What companies are spending a lot on a green transition, are they actually sustainable, where do they do most of their sustainability projects. All good questions to ask of a company in your job search. 
5. **Certifications are a good way to break into sustainability, but not infallible** \- One of the best ones to get right now is the LEED certification which teaches you how to make buildings/the built environment more sustainable. It's most commonly used at civil and environmental engineering firms, but is pervasive. GRI is another good one which helps with reporting and recording corporate emissions. This is best suited to strategic management type roles, but not really worth the cost IMO. You can teach yourself how to do it without paying thousands for the cert. SASB is a certification that teaches you how to deal with emissions trading systems. Think of it as a green accountant license. Finally, Lean Six Sigma is kind of like a green project management degree. This one is almost like a 2 for 1 where Lean is focused on reducing waste and six sigma on reducing defect rates. Most often, it is used in industrial engineering/manufacturing/logistics companies. That's not to say there aren't many more, but these are the ones I would consider most worth it.
6. **Learn the Sstandards** \- If you imagine a certification is like a degree, the standards would be the study-guides and cheat-sheets.  A bunch of standards are combined to create frameworks, which would be like the syllabus in the example. Along with being the foundation for certifications, they can also develop from regulations or industry habits. ISO is a very common framework in many industries, but  I will leave you guys to find ones relevant to your own backgrounds. 
7. **Stay Up-to-Date** \- Sustainability continues to trend and it is really important to keep up on the news. Watch what your governments are doing at all levels. Policies, geopolitics, regulation and the like can all create and eliminate opportunities. Think of this more generally though because it can get depressing at times. It is much better to watch a non MSM news source like bloomberg, yahoo finance, cheddar news, TYT, Now This (my preferences) as they don't fear monger as much. Moreover, the financial ones may show you a company or job you would never knew existed before. 
8. **Sustainability Should be Second to your Niche** \- It can be tempting to just get a degree in sustainability and expect a job given the pervasiveness of it in job descriptions. That simply isn't the case. Employers are looking for your niche or subject matter expertise, and sustainability is neither to them. This isn't to say you shouldn't pursue a degree in sustainability, you just have to make sure to cater research and electives to specific industries. E.g. I went down a business analytics route and wrote reports as if I was a consultant to industrial/civil/aviation along with analytic heavy courses. If I didn't take any 'green' courses, my niche could be described as data driven infrastructure strategy. Now I have a bunch of different homeworks, reports, etc. to present to potential employers.
9. **Remember: Sustainability is a HUGE Opportunity** \- Yes, the world is actually making a green transition (or at least try. Companies are now being driven by things like; the pandemic, increased supply chain stress, remote work, the social movement for a green planet, and the opportunity costs of being unsustainable to name a few. Sustainable solutions often lead to cost savings so it is in their best interests to start as soon as possible. Companies who don't change become laggards and risk closure due to loss of competitive advantage.

86,Are EMPs Real?,"Preppers worry about all sorts of world ending and society toppling events and disasters, and one that is whispered about the most, near the very top of the pantheon of catastrophes is the EMP.

&amp;#x200B;

solar flare

EMPs, or electromagnetic pulses are broadly discussed throughout the preppersphere, and feature prominently in all sorts of disaster and doomsday media, from books to movies and video games. But for all of this mystique, are EMPs real?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, EMPs are entirely real, and can occur as a result of natural terrestrial or stellar phenomena such as solar storms or lightning, or may be created by man-made devices, including nuclear weapons and EMP generators.

https://preview.redd.it/83gf5a4lw1h81.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=045c80ac267513e2b94a08158d730a877abfccf9

&amp;#x200B;

Chances are you have heard by now just how devastating a severe EMP could be to society at large. Out of all of the doomsday scenarios that we might prepare for, it is the EMP threat that is perhaps the most likely to occur.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of this article will serve as a primer to help you orient yourself towards this threat and prepare for it.

&amp;#x200B;

The Threat is Entirely Real

Although the threat of EMPs might be hyped, it is hardly embellished. Grimly, EMPs are entirely real and massively powerful EMPs resulting from any common source could be enough to plunge modern civilizations back into the Stone Age.

&amp;#x200B;

And EMPs, believe it or not, are not just some techno-supremacist threat that has arisen because of mankind’s meddling with the impossible power of the atom and other technologies.

&amp;#x200B;

EMPs have been around pretty much as long as the universe has, but we’ll talk more about that later.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, you have to take an EMP threat seriously as it is one of the most endemic threats of our era, and one of the most likely of the truly cataclysmic threats facing advanced civilizations.

&amp;#x200B;

The Stakes are High

So what does an EMP do? An EMP, or electromagnetic pulse, is exactly what it says. It is a high energy burst or emanation of electrical energy that is typically of short duration that can have significant and dramatic effects against anything that uses a circuit board or relies upon other radiation to operate.

&amp;#x200B;

A powerful EMP will blow fuses, fry circuits, overload electrical systems, and do much, much more.

&amp;#x200B;

Although not directly harmful to organic material, the second and third order effects can be calamitous, and you should expect fires to break out in and around settled areas because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps more importantly, you’ll be facing an eerie and quiet dawn of a world devoid of electricity and electronics. Modern vehicles won’t operate.

&amp;#x200B;

Smart devices will be stone cold dead. Even electro optical sites on your firearms will be history. It will be quite literally like turning the clock back on our technology many decades.

&amp;#x200B;

EMP’s May be Natural or Man-Made

So, now that we understand what EMPs are and what they do, it is time to dig into where they come from. As alluded to above, EMPs can be generated by natural events or a variety of man-made devices.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, most naturally occurring EMPs are considerably lower power and limited effect compared to man-made ones, even though natural EMPs can affect a huge swath of the globe under the right circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

Man-made EMPs on the other hand tend to be ferociously powerful, potentially devastating, but will generally affect a smaller area, even if this is only comparatively smaller.

&amp;#x200B;

Certain man-made EMPs have the potential to affect entire regions or countries!

&amp;#x200B;

Solar Storms and Lightning, Very Frightening

Two of the most common causes of naturally occurring EMPs are solar storms, specifically coronal mass ejections, and common lightning. The activity of our sun, the nearest star, creates powerful cosmic magnetic fields that affect our planet.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually we only perceive this in a meaningful way due to phenomenal like the Aurora Borealis. Occasionally though, a sharp increase in this activity can generate an EMP that will cross the solar gulf and deleteriously affect electronics on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been several recorded historical examples of this, one in the 20th century that greatly disrupted radio and telephone communications across much of North America.

&amp;#x200B;

Although there is little doubt that solar activity could produce an EMP many, many times more powerful than that it is uncertain exactly how likely this is to occur or how pressing the threat may be.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, natural occurrences such as lightning generate powerful but highly localized EMP fields that can fry electronics and overload electrical systems or the lightning strikes or near where it strikes.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people probably know of someone, at least tangentially, who has had their home or automobile electronics significantly damaged or destroyed outright by lightning strike. That is EMP in action!

&amp;#x200B;

Nukes and NNEMPs

On the other hand, there are man-made EMPs, and to most preppers these are the ones that we really need to worry about. The most infamous of man-made EMPs is that of the nuclear EMP, specifically a side effect originating from the detonation of a nuclear warhead.

&amp;#x200B;

Although most folks worry about, rightly, surviving the immensely bright light, cataclysmic heat, obliterating pressure and deadly radiation but in the bargain they will have to deal with EMP effects that radiate out from the center of the blast, affecting everything within line of sight.

&amp;#x200B;

This means that response and relief efforts to such a catastrophic event will be further hampered thanks to the effects of the EMP.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, some experts predict that the best use of a nuclear warhead might be a high altitude detonation that will in essence provide a far, far larger area of effect for the EMP compared to a detonation closer to the ground as destructive as that might be.

&amp;#x200B;

Other man-made sources of EMP come from specialty EMP generating weapons or industrial EMP generators, both falling into the category of NNEMPs, or non-nuclear EMPs.

&amp;#x200B;

They lack the substantial area of effect attendant with a nuclear warhead detonation, but both could potentially be weaponized to ill effect. Thankfully, most are used for scientific and testing purposes presently.

&amp;#x200B;

EMP Protection and Preparation

Preparing for an EMP is no easy thing, since most civilian sector solutions are often expensive, difficult to implement and of dubious effectiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

Critical government and military installations and precious few private concerns might be protected against EMP threats through the redundant use of insulating enclosures known as Faraday cages and hardened electronics packages which are capable of withstanding the immense energy levels of the EMP.

&amp;#x200B;

This is all fine and good for the military and government, but what about for the rest of us? Well, sadly most of us are probably pretty screwed at least when it comes to our technology.

&amp;#x200B;

Though it is theoretically possible to construct your own Faraday cages, there is no real way to effectively test them for efficacy. Basically, you’ll just have to have faith in it which translates to you are wishing and hoping that it works.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, that is not a good strategy. One good strategy that can ensure continuity of operations or at least the sustainment of capability is to rely on “retro tech” gear and vehicle choices that cannot be affected by an EMP.

&amp;#x200B;

Older vehicles that don’t use computers, analog signaling capability, iron sights and more all have their uses for EMP preparation. If the EMP can’t break it your stuff won’t be broken should one occur!

&amp;#x200B;

So There You Have It…

EMPs are real, and are definitely not just the realm of fiction and doomsday speculation.

&amp;#x200B;

-living sustainable is cheaper. You want to water your plants but don’t want to pay your water bill? Fill up that bucket with rain water. start a garden and have food for all summer and avoid having to drive to the grocery store for produce

Pretty much all gear nowadays is baseline ok, it’s the negatives that really set things apart.

For once, let's turn it all upside down:

We should build a collection about how things break - review broken and worn-out products to teach how to identify cheap products. That's why I built the free and non-profit site called [failscout.co](https://failscout.co)

It's simple: You upload your broken products and quickly describe how long you owned them, how often you used them, and where they failed.

What could we do with all this data?

* Identifying the common failure modes of products
* See if a product's quality has changed or gone down at some point
* Everything breaks eventually, but when it does, can you easily repair/fix it?
* I'll add a simple JSON API so other sites and projects can leverage our data.

53,Sustainable Energy,"What is energy sustainability?☝💭❓

* Although we are not at full sustainability, it is possible with correct measures taken this includes:
   * Not using fossil fuels❌
   * Not being greedy with the energy❌
   * Relying on renewables❌

Here’s how you're using energy!!😱😦

* Being inefficient with energy actually adds up (multiple tons of CO2 a year; I even calculated mine to be 20 CO2 tons/year **WOW**)
* Everyday electronics slowly suck power through the outlets
* Leaving lights turned on when you leave a room
* Turning heat up in the winter or turning ac down in the summer helps reduce usage

What does energy sustainability mean for the planet and what are the SDGs??🌎

* Cost from climate change about public health and safety 
* SDGs are Sustainable Development Goals that aim for a better future
* SDGs are developed by the United Nations
* Clean energy might be nice, but it’s not cheap
* Responsible consumption and production is key
* Cleaner energy means climate action

How you should get involved and contribute to sustainable energy!😀🌱

* Support green energy initiatives✅
   * Solar farms
   * Wind turbine farms
   * Nuclear energy 
   * Geothermal heating 
   * Hydro power
* Vote people into office with green platforms✅

58,Buying and breaking ships?,"There's been a few attempts to buy and close coal mines and oil leases by environmental organizations in the past decade, which could help a fair bit in keeping fossil fuels in the ground.

What about doing the same with ships? 90% of commerce (READ: mostly unnecessary ""Consumer Goods"") travel by ship, and most at this juncture travel by container ship (MORE INFORMATION: [https://unctad.org/webflyer/review-maritime-transport-2020](https://unctad.org/webflyer/review-maritime-transport-2020) ). By purchasing and retiring (Termed ""Breaking"" in maritime parlance) specifically Container Ships, starting with older, less efficient ships and moving up to massive vessels which carry up to 24,000 twenty-foot container units, the capacity to ship consumer goods declines. By spinning such a campaign up in the middle of a freight crisis, freight rates would become prohibitively costly, making the overseas manufacture and importation of most low-value, non-essential goods uneconomic. 

Since  40% of Maritime Trade is fossil Fuels, taking a few VLCCs (Very Large Crude Carriers of over 200,000 tons capacity) out of the market would make fossil fuel transport prices rise rapidly. At the same time, the actual ability to move fuel would be reduced in absolute as well as price terms, forcing adaptation in oil-importing countries and regions. Don't forget, a lot of these ships burn over 100 tons of fuel per day of operations at sea while going only about 18 miles per hour, and operate over 200 days per year. In port they usually only burn about 5-10 tons of diesel or bunker fuel per day.

I work in a Maritime-Adjacent field, which is what made me think of this. The fact of the matter is that it's faster to break ships than build them, and with current economics, Sailing Ships will be both more profitable and orders of magnitude more fuel efficient than conventional vessels (SEE: [https://www.jmwe.org/uploads/1/0/6/4/106473271/jmwe\_17\_august\_2021.pdf](https://www.jmwe.org/uploads/1/0/6/4/106473271/jmwe_17_august_2021.pdf) and [www.Wind-ship.org](https://www.Wind-ship.org) ). If environmental groups can force shipping capacity down, they force consumption and resource use down as well.

With the average vessel life span being some 20-40 years, though, there has to be a force to make people retire older ships faster. Since ship breaking has declined precipitously since 2017, there's little to show that vessels will be retired at all until they sink or break in the harbor. Everything afloat is being used to its utmost capacity right now due to the crisis, and volume of trade is growing faster than ships can be built, which is what's pushing ship breaking rates down. On top of this, the average new-build ship is 4-9 times larger than it was 20 years ago.

I'm curious what people's thoughts on this would be.",sustainability,1643590590

Meds aren't labeled as ""gluten-free"" and medicine bottles are very wasteful. 

Cabinet Health is a sustainable medicine company that has created an innovative solution to the world's pharmaceutical plastic problem. The company is a certified B-corp (so no BS)! They give you a frosted glass jar with a magnetic medicine label on it and refills of pills in a compostable pouch! I'm probably not the best at explaining it, but 

On top of that, they test all their products for gluten (meds are certified to be gluten-free), carcinogens, and quality. They only have a few over the counter options now, but I spoke with a kind customer service rep who said they're releasing more soon, yay!

&gt;""...I wish to first share two critical observations about this scale.  The first observation is that most people find folks one or two levels above them to be pretty cool, but people three levels up seem a bit nutty. People four or five levels up seem downright crazy. And people six levels up should probably be institutionalized for their own safety and the safety of those around them. I find the latter reactions to be inappropriate.  If people seem crazy they might just be advanced on the same path you're following.  The second observation is that most people find folks one level back to be ignorant. And people two levels back seem like assholes. Any further back and people start to think that the person should be shot on sight for the betterment of society as a whole.  I find that ALL of these reactions are inappropriate. **People will not change if you yell at them or hit them with sticks. But they WILL change if you tell them about the cool stuff that's just a little bit ahead of where they are now and skip the stuff that is far ahead of them.**""

16,Where do you find sustainable product alternatives and how do you know they are more sustainable?,"Hey everyone,  
I am a huge sustainability fan and think about how we can have an impact on a daily basis.  
What always made me wonder was the fact that we say ""vote with your money"", in other words we should support companies that do good and try to avoid companies that do bad. But why is it so difficult to find these companies that do good? The companies that pay the extra money for a better planet, that go the extra mile?

I made a tool that collects these sustainable products and companies: [http://sustainablealternativeto.com/](http://sustainablealternativeto.com/)

Instead of trying to come up with a sustainability score or trying to get companies on a directory etc, I thought of a much simpler solution to create a database that lists sustainable brands and products. There are many great labels out there, that do exceptional work to verify aspects of a companies' sustainability. We simply collect them in a huge database and let you filter by each sustainability aspect such as climate neutral, socially responsible (B Corp certified), vegan, plastic free, circular, or multi use.

One thing is clear. The products and companies that fall under these labels are better then the ones who don't. It's as simple as that. Are they perfect. No. Should we still support them? Absolutely. We carefully select only the labels that stood our due diligence, because not all labels are great.

Truth be told, this website is a proof pf concept. Technically absolutely feasible. It's made with Airtable and Softr and could easily connect to APIs and other services.  
If you think you would benefit from such a directly, please consider subscribing to our waitlist. If we reach 100+ people I will find the resources to make this a reality!   


Seriously where do you get your alternatives from?",sustainability,1642435313

I've just launched [Offsetmy.flights](https://Offsetmy.flights) (✈️❤️🌍). I was frustrated by the lack of a really simple service for offsetting flights. Not flying is always the best option, and carbon offsets have their challenges. However given many of us will choose to fly at some point, the last we can do is offset our emissions.

If found existing services had a lengthily checkout process, didn't support Apple Pay and Google Pay, and didn't let you choose the offset project you want to support.

We've partnered with [Patch.io](https://Patch.io) for offsetting. We take a small $0.50 fee per offset to cover costs. This is mainly a side project I created because I wanted to use it myself. 

I hope others find it useful too, and I'm keen to hear feedback an opinions 🙏",sustainability,1642428494

30,Why debates about veganism get so contentious,"As I was reading through [this thread about veganism that went viral on r/environment](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/s4g4jc/oxford_university_veganism_is_single_biggest_way/) I was so saddened about the amount of anger and resentment and contentiousness throughout the comments. I wasn’t surprised though: every forum I’ve ever been in where this topic came up has had similar tones emerging.

I want to open a meta discussion about why is it that we can’t talk about this topic calmly and empathetically. Clearly if it happens everywhere there is some larger dynamic at play and it doesn’t have to do with just individual personalities clashing or individual communities.

My perception is that it seems the tone turns angry because there’s over-simplification of this topic and also a lack of empathy. I’d like to point out 2 patterns I’m seeing: 

1. I notice this pattern in discussion: “Going vegan is so easy! Everyone should do it no excuses!” Reply: “It’s very hard for some people for x reasons (cultural, location, behavior)” reply: “I did it, so it should be easy!” Reply: “Just because you did it it doesn’t mean it’s easy” … spiral continues.

The issue here is that no one seems to acknowledge their own POV when coming into the discussion and assume their POV is representative of a global one. Eg my POV as someone who’s mainly lived in urban areas in Western countries is very different than someone else’s who has lived in a rural area in some other part of the world. Our experience of the topic is completely different, our customs, behavior, access, lifestyle, income… you name it, are entirely different. Everyone comes into these threads without properly acknowledging their POV and proceed to state their opinions like they are global truths “I did it, so you can!” “It’s affordable no excuses!” — we are really missing the point and not acknowledging other people’s perspectives and the incredibly complex nuances of this problem. How can we approach discussion with more curiosity instead of imposing our “truths”? How can we expand our knowledge of this topic instead of entering with fixed assumptions we are not willing to let go of? How can we acknowledge our POV before entering these discussions so as so contextualize our truths in different spheres? Curious to hear y’all’s thoughts.

2. The second pattern (of many patterns, I’m only calling out 2) is some people are just straight up anti-vegan and will come in with very aggressive stances saying corporations make the most impact and we cannot possibly match that and we’re being brainwashed to feel guilty about our actions while corporations get away with it. This is a false dichotomy as I’ve seen many people pointing out… we don’t need to choose. We can do both. Hold corporations accountable, work to solve social inequities that lead to environmental justice issues AND be vegan or reduce. Can we say more YES AND as opposed to NO BUTs and break this false dichotomy we’ve created?

Overall I think we need more listening and more empathy, and less aggression/imposing.

Hope this doesn’t turn into a sh*tshow in the discussion.",sustainability,1642279295

34,"Is the US going in the wrong direction on plastic packaging? If so, why?","I don't know how it is elsewhere, but it seems like plastic packaging is increasing in the US. Certain products that used less plastic, such as powdered laundry detergent (packaged in cardboard boxes) or concentrated shampoo (which used a smaller plastic squeeze-tube instead of a larger plastic bottle) have mostly disappeared. Other products, such as milk, eggs, and orange juice, increasingly use plastic or styrofoam instead of paper-based packaging. The more expensive products aimed at affluent eco-conscious consumers may still use paper-based packaging, but the most economical products generally use plastic or styrofoam.

Caveat: The above is just personal observation; I don't have stats. But if my observations are accurate, next question is, why? I guess the easy answer is that plastic packaging is cheaper, and consumer preferences explain why some products have disappeared. But I'm not sure about that. US consumers are cost-conscious, and while that would explain why many would buy eggs in styrofoam if they're cheaper than eggs in cardboard, by the same token many would still buy powdered detergent, which was cheaper than liquid. So why are detergent manufacturers pushing liquids and pods? I gather that powdered detergent is still widely used outside the US.

I've heard that the petroleum industry is pushing plastic packaging to make up for reduced use of oil for energy (current and projected). It makes sense that plastic packaging might have been more expensive in the 70s and 80s when there was greater demand for oil as fuel and less domestic supply. I wonder if there is anything else going on that would lead manufacturers of consumer products to use more plastic packaging.",sustainability,1642266606

Natural Environment  
Built Environment

41,Looking for ideas on how to make new home more sustainable! UK based,"Hello everyone!

I was wondering if I could pick some brains as to what I can do to make my new home as healthy/sustainable as possible. This to me includes keeping energy and water usage down, repairable / reusable products, healthy (both physically and mentally) inside (plants/plant wall, that type of thing) and good lighting that is energy efficient and also good for us inhabitants.

For info, this house is a new-build in the UK, and we will move in around April time. Some items I have no choice in, such as the white goods they use for the kitchen (we reserved the house post-decision/ordering time). It should be well insulated but also ventilated so no issues with damp or mould. If I had my way, I’d build a house with everything I want already built in, including a ground source heat pump!

So far, I have a few things on my list that I can do:

- Dualit Toaster and Kettle - these are very high quality, efficient and made in the UK, and are built to be easy to repair and replace components
 Lifespan of 20+ years.
- Thermostatic Radiator Valves - control the heat on a room by room basis rather than heating the whole house on the thermostat. 
- May look into energy suppliers that use renewable sources (more tricky at the moment since so many are going bust with our energy crisis atm)
- Using smol cleaning products for general cleaning, as well as washing tablets and fabric conditioner, and dishwasher tabs. Note here, I may just stop using fabric conditioner as I’m not sure it’s really necessary!

My list feels kinda short but there’s already lifestyle changes we’ve made too. But can anyone add anything else that’s a potentially easy win?

In an effort to start a conversation about what the world needs to look like a few centuries from now, we have created a very succinct description of a sustainable global civilization. By choosing a long time frame and by not getting bogged down in details about politics, economics and technology we think we may be able to stimulate some discussion and agreement from folks across the political spectrum.

I've gone vegetarian (except for jello, which is my one exception), I walk or take the light rail to all my classes, and my waste production has gone way down, but I still want to do more. My state has about 50% low carbon electricity so I'm more concerned about heating- my building has a coal boiler. But I'm also looking for anything I can do, no matter how small!

Does anyone have advice for additional things I can do to reduce my footprint? When I go back for spring semester I'll be reducing the temperature in my room and working on reducing how much dairy and eggs. But what other things can I do?",sustainability,1641540401

I purchased some regular cotton basics as well. Lately, I have the urge to go GOTS certified for just about everything. However, this is obviously expensive and will take time to build a solid wardrobe. I used to wash all my Pact clothing together, now I mixed everything to save energy and water. So what I’m wondering is how much chemicals from my regular cottons are transfer into my expensive organic cottons. I plan to purchase more but I don’t want to be wasteful and throw away any of the regular cotton shirts I’ve bought. Does washing   Regular cotton and GOTs cotton really ruin the certified stuff? I’m talking about chemicals from dyes and pesticides mainly. Should I just continue washing the clothes I’ve had together and start to wash only GOTS stuff together? It seems like a grey area honestly and to have enough for a full load… I mean I’m no mathematician but it’s gonna be a few more hundred dollars until I have enough to make it separate. Anyone else have this issue? If so, any suggestions? Should I start washing the regular with regular and gots with gots? Would really appreciate some good input.

While surely a good way to finance ocean clean-up (the more you clean up, the more money you can make). I can't but help seeing this as accounting magic. After all, my supplier is still selling non-biodegradable disposable plastic. But now claims it's ""neutral"" towards the environment because they funded the cleaning of someone else's plastic waste?

64,Maybe we shouldn’t live sustainably,"



Let me be clear, i genuinely thought we should stop climate change at first. I am not a troll, or some kind of weirdo. I’m also a vegan activist.
Before you start reading: be aware that our desire to live is also biological, not entirely objective. Once you realize that, you can be open minded to the idea that non existence is not that bad.
Here is why I think one shouldn’t be a climate activist, and shouldn’t make an effort to live a green lifestyle. But the only effort one should make if he wants to do good, is to be anti climate activist. in order to help climate change do it’s thing). I suppose I have had this thought for at least one year, in the darkest deepest part of my mind: the world is full with endless suffering. Therefore, It would be better if life didn’t exist on earth at all.
Now two things:
• we couldn’t destroy all life on earth even if we tried. We got animals here that can even survive in the outer space for a few years, so that’s off the table.
• if humans weren’t on earth, it would be undoubtedly the best thing that could ever happen. And that’s part of the reason why I want climate change to take over the world(to fully or almost fully extinct all humans). A new better world will be born from the ashes of the climate apocalypse. A world free from humans(that create the most suffering on earth, so much that we can’t even imagine). And the apocalypse might even be worth the suffering it will cause to humans and animals.
I know that animals will die and suffer horribly, and that they will be affected first. But remember, the apocalypse will be an extremely short era in earth’s history, which means that it’s close range consequences will be nothing compared to its long range consequences, which will be good.
Most of the avoidable unnecessary victims of now are victims of humans. And yes, the victims of the climate apocalypse will be victims as well. However they will be gone for a good reason for a change.
And it doesn’t really matter who will have to be extinct or be affected first, by the apocalypse. Please notice that I have the perfect reason not to have value of life anymore. The life in the wild must be too bad to consider them as good, therfore it’s not a big loss if a lot of animals die. I’d consider to extinct all life from earth if I could. Animals in the wild suffer from hunger, injuries, weather. One day i saw that poor cat I saw outside, and then realized that there are a lot cats like him. They absolutely must extremely suffer from the rain and cold. Most of us western humans dont know and don’t have to experience even 10% of this pain, because we are so far from this survival situation, thanks to unbelievably accessible and high technology. Now think about all the insects, and ants. Every drop of rain can cause them the most long and painful death. They must be terrified. And this is only a very little example. This is why I don’t think it a loss of animal life on earth will be reduced due to the climate(life is not that good, even bad).
by the way, believe me, I am well aware of horrible consequences of not stopping climate change, to both humans and non humans. And it does make sad not less that it makes you. But I think I really have the perfect reason to be sure that it will be worth it, for the greater good.
There is a high possibility that it will prevent more suffering than it will create. Keep in mind, if we killed humans in the pace we kill animals, it would take maybe. A week until we were all dead. Earth now is already a huge intensive consistent factory of suffering, because of humans. We could  cancel  most of this factory for at least 100000 years. All it takes is just few especially intense decades of suffering, and that’s it. I know the cost is exteremly painful, but overall it worths it great deal

98,Sharing Sustainable Housing Plans; show me what you got!,"Hey everyone, newbie here.

Like many of you, I'm beyond tired of the daily rise and grind at a minimum wage job that has squeezed the productivity out of me like a lemon to the point where I feel like I've been ground into a fine powder. I'm only 26 but I have been in the workforce for nearly 11 years (completely on my own not living with family since i was 14) and have absolutely nothing to show for it. I have no savings, I've never held a job that gave me benefits or a raise, and I'm currently barely scraping by in a one bedroom apartment. 

My solution to this is to build a completely sustainable home where I will use as few resources as possible. I have been thinking about this for nearly 5 years and have a few mock drawings that plan out an easily built home that relies on geothermal heating and cooling, solar energy, strategic window and roof overhang placement, and geothermal walls to provide plenty of light and heat irregardless of the season and outdoor temperature. Minor adjustments can be made to these house plans to maximize efficiency in different climates. The least sustainable part of these housing plans includes the use of concrete and antifreeze liquid, which we all know contributes heavily to overall greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere and has disastrous affectson surrounding groundand underground water tables if a leak occurs, respectively.

Below is an idea of what I'm planning, but I want to see what other people are planning also! 

I live in the Northern hemisphere on the west coast of the United States in the PNW. 
For an above ground home:
I am planning this home to be about 1200 square feet with a joined kitchen and living room, full bathroom and connected laundry, a long hallway that extends past two bedrooms and leads into a south facing greenhouse which will border the homes' concrete thermal mass wall. I plan on the greenhouse capturing heat during the day year-round and slowly releasing it into the bedrooms throughout the night. Outside of the greenhouse will be deciduous trees that will block the Sun from overheating the greenhouse in the summer, while losing its leaves in the winter allowing full heat absorption for the concrete thermal mass wall. Below the flooring I will have a geothermal heating and cooling system that will consist of long thick tubes filled with an antifreeze agent that will heat or cool the home to a constant 50-60°F temperature. Extra heating or cooling will be achieved by sun lights and vents throughout the house. The roof will be a double skillion with flat gentle slopes for solar panels and room for extra windows for lighting and passive heat capture.

For an Earth sheltered home:
A single story home with one exposed wall that will be very similar in plan to the above ground home except without the need for an antifreeze filled geothermal heating and cooling tube but will require much more concrete for stabilization. This home will also be virtually earthquake proof as well as sound proof.

There are plenty of pros and cons between an earth sheltered home and a traditional above ground home, and my future plans for building either are heavily dependent on the type of land that I can find...which is almost exclusively depending on its price. I don't have a lot of money so right now I am searching primarily for at least one acre of land, preferably with some wooded area on the property, in an area that is not extremely close to the ocean or tectonic fault lines, as well as being close enough to the city to where I can get to the hospital in time after being worst-case-scenario'ed by a cougar.

I have a book list and a public YouTube playlist that I can share here to give curious people some insight as to where I'm getting all of my information.

Calculate your sun position to maximize your solar efficiency [here](https://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php)

Book list:
- The Homeowners Guide to Renewable Energy by Dan Chiras
- Building a Sustainable Home by Melissa Rappaport Schifman
- Residential Energy 6th Ed. by John Krigger
- Drafting and Design for Architecture by Dana Hepler, Paul Ross Wallach, Donald Hepler

YouTube playlist [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUz6tTKgb3J2K2FdyhoxNnbUlFm54-wBN)

I come here posting this for a few reasons:

- I want to share information that I have gathered over the last 5 years with other people who may not have access to that information, or have even better information that we can all build upon together to maximize efficiency.
- I have a few blind spots that I personally haven't been able to find better solutions for in my house building plans and want to put this out as a beacon for help correcting those blind spots. For example, I really don't like the amount of concrete I'm going to theoretically use in either of these builds and I really don't like the idea of putting antifreeze in a tube Underground because of my fears surrounding leakage and poisoning underground water resources or the land.
- I firmly believe that free information sharing is going to be a great way in the future for people to take their own lives into their own hands not only for better quality of life purposes but also to help us all become better stewards of our environment. Of course giant corporations going around spilling tons of sewage and garbage into local watersheds will never be outweighed by a few people living completely sustainably, but while governments drag their feet on putting pro-earth laws into action this can be a way to feel like you have some control over your own carbon footprint as an individual. 

If you read this entire book worth of rambling out of me, congratulations. What I want most out of this post is to hear what you plan for sustainability in your own home. If you are making any renovations to your home to make it more sustainable, if you have worked on other people's homes to increase sustainability, if you understand how solar panels work and want to share that information (it's hard info to sink in, for me!) please feel free to share.

The main reason I am asking is that I would like to compile this information and make it public, for more awareness.

As well ad many other reduction and sustainable practices.

Now, I'm developing a 'big idea' Bulk Food store in my area, but it's taking  longer than i thought (but not shocking) to collect the rest of my  funding...as it's a lot. So, in the mean time, and to try and spur  another smaller sustainable project along, I'm gifting away a small  portion of my funding to lift another project up. As it could take a  while for NLB to get going, and I don't want to sit idle if another  project can get up and running sooner!

This amount won't effect me getting the total funding that i need, as that is WAY bigger.

My  question to anyone out there: how can I get my gift away message out  there? So far it's been a total shut down as I've been getting flagged, blocked, and marked as spam.

Any thoughts?

Thanks!

Heres the first study: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348005008_Life_Cycle_Assessment_of_Beverage_Packaging/fulltext/604dd10292851c2b23c98f26/Life-Cycle-Assessment-of-Beverage-Packaging.pdf?origin=publication_detail

and to quote the conclusion:

""The results found that in each category there was a less impactful beverage packaging than plastic bottles. In the Pressurised Beverage Category, 100% recycled aluminium cans would be the least impactful option, in the Fruit Juice Beverage Category Tetra Pak would be the least impactful option and in the Milk Beverage Category milk cartons would be the least impactful option.""


Heres another one done on wine containers:

And another one on aluminum containers:

------

TetraPak appears the best option overall, but please read the sources, and find more. From what I've read it appears that l glass far from bring the solution, Despite the popular perception. **But Please read more And if needed challenge this conclusion.** As of now, I've read a portion of the text contents of the studies, and all of the conclusions, So I advise everyone to read the entire thing.

I see so many people not checking what research says when choosing sustainable packaging and making posts about it, which has lead to people seeing glass as somehow the sustainable option. Well, for drink packging, neither of them appear to be the sustainable option.

The third Source also covers aluminium cans recycling rates across countries. This impacts the sustainability score of aluminium cans, as less recycling means significantly higher impacts.

--

In light of these findings and Due to the complexity of Tetrapak packaging (several layers), I invite everyone to dig really deep on this topic. Search more. Find relevant studies both on Google and Google scholar. There might be studies linked on Wikipedia I'm pages about different kinds of packaging.

Which ever is in the end the least unsustainable, it appears to me that glass bottles are off that list.

---

Conclusion:

**As always, the most sustainable option is simply to not to buy any drinks in the shop, and instead consume tap water. This is what we should be doing more often, if your local supply isnt poisoned (arsenic or smth,)**

I only drink tap water, And in addition to that there's only tetrapak milk in smallish quantities (intolerant and flexitarian). 

But it really helps to take A really deep dive into topics like these, as education is the first step towards effective activism

I loved how both Portugal and Spain had excellent public transportation systems and recycling bins interspersed around public spaces. Aruba really surprised me bc they used paper and bamboo utensils everywhere. The grocery stores mostly had paper and bamboo utensils, cups, and plates, but sadly, they all came packaged in plastic :/ The large grocery store there made you use reusable shopping bags and charged you extra if you asked for the plastic alternative. I was kind of surprised that they didn't have reef protection initiatives in place or more protection against littering at beaches and stuff considering how much tourism they get from people coming to scuba dive and snorkel. Didn't really notice a lot of environmental strides being taken in El Salvador, but it's a bigger problem when the US doesn't do much to protect the environment considering how much Europe and the rest of the world seems to be trying. I dont know if anyone watched Don't Look Up, but that's what I feel like trying to get people to take climate change seriously, so I appreciate this community so much for their actions",sustainability,1640487822

What specifically drives public support for the repair economy? What are the motivations and barriers to repair? These questions and more will be answered through your participation in this survey which is focused around the repair economy and right to repair movement.

* Estimated Time needed for this survey: **12 minutes**
* All data collected in this survey is anonymous.

**Further details:**

The paper, which will be based on this survey, aims to prove/disprove the model developed in the paper:

*""Repair motivation and barriers model: Investigating user perspectives related to product repair towards a circular economy""* published by Terzioğlu Nazli in the Journal of Cleaner Production in 2021.

In addition, this paper also attempts to further develop that model by gathering additional in depth data on each aspect of that model as well as use it to generate insights into the public support behind both the repair economy and the right to repair movement.

I would be honored if you would take \~12 minutes of your time and fill out this survey. Naturally I would also be grateful for any feedback on the survey if you have any.

Thank you very much in advance.

1. Stopped buying anything I do not actually need, super proud of this one because I used to buy a lot of clothes and shoes. I try to avoid going shopping under any circumstances. 
2. Get most of my books out of the library instead of accumulating new ones. This hopefully will save a tree somewhere (I read a lot), but it has the nice advantage of sticking it to Jeff Bezos and his slavery-funded penis rocket!
3. Switched to solid soaps and shampoos. I am still on a lesrning curve with the solid shampoo, since I have quite thick hair, but I won’t go back.

4. Started composting! We got a small bin for the back garden and now have much less waste.

67,Some articles i needed to write for my Service &amp; Action,"Delaying climate mitigation action and allowing for transitory temperature overshoots necessitate large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the second half of this century, which may have negative consequences for land, food, and ecosystems. Meanwhile, attaining climate targets without global net-negative emissions necessitates early and quick emission reduction actions, which poses immediate problems. We examine the implications of scenarios that do not rely on land-based CDR technology for land-use and food systems. Early climate action provides various benefits and trade-offs, and it prevents the need for substantial (mitigation-induced) changes in land use in the long run. Long-term benefits include cheaper food prices, a lower risk of starvation, and less demand for irrigation water. Simultaneously, near-term mitigating pressures in the agriculture, forest, and land-use sectors, as well as the required land area for energy crops, increase, leading to an increased danger of food shortages.

Following the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2020. Carbon dioxide is the most significant GHG. To satisfy this commitment, governments must address the sustainability problem of offsetting expanding population and wealth by dematerializing less energy per GDP and decarbonizing less carbon per energy. I examined carbon dioxide emissions from 1993 to 2004 to see if meeting the challenge was feasible. Although emissions in the Union as a whole increased by only 0.31 percent per year on average, emissions and their drivers differed significantly between the 27 member states. There was some dematerialization and decarbonization, but not enough to counteract the minor population growth and fast expanding prosperity. To complete its debt within the next 12 years, The EU27 would have to dematerialize and decarbonize 1.9–2.6 times faster than it did from 1993 to 2004 to offset its growing population and wealth. As a result, completing its duty only by reducing fossil carbon emissions is quite doubtful.",sustainability,1639481770

Main idea was this: you will need MUCH less water to flush and effectively move solid waste if the water is extracted from it first.

Other ideas:

* Require use of greywater for flushing
* Two waste systems, starting at the toilet: one for urine, another for solid waste
* Use a little extra energy at the flush so that less water is required to move waste to press tank
* Possibly even sanitize and reuse some of the initial flush water.

Unrelated to waste ideas:

My question is: is eating every day seitan unhealthy?

We should keep in mind 4 points:

1) seitan is a highly processed food since it is basically ""condensed gluten"" from wheat.

2) When you eat s. you take a lot of gluten. Of course people usually eat additional sources of gluten like pasta, cereals and bread. Of course you can increase rice (or other gluten free products) reducing other gluten based foods. I don't think I am wrong but 50 g of seitan contain more gluten than 350 g of pasta/bread.
Moreover many people claim that the quality of gluten has been decreasing since they introduced genetically modified grains (they should be called cultivar). Unfortunately I am not an expert in this field.

3) When I say eating s. evey day I mean 50 g of seitan per day and I am talking about a pure seitan steak. Many seitan products contain more than 40% of soy.

4) Please dont say ""eating every day seitan is better than meat"" since we are discussing seitan per se.

43,"Studies on the relative impacts of different vegetable oils. Please read, it's important.","
I see a very problematic damaging factoid about palm oil has become established in green spaces. It seems to be very pervasive.

I will post numerous recent sources for my claims here. See the sources below and quotes from them about that

So lets start. 

**_Palm oil is in reality one of the less damaging oils._**

**Heres the relative impact of different cooking oils, with sources (studies included) and quotes;**

1.	https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-13-01813/article_deploy/sustainability-13-01813.pdf

⁠""In an effort to reduce environmental damage, a number of public campaigns have led to consumer pressure on food companies, resulting in the substitution of palm oil with al- ternative vegetable oils and the labelling of palm oil-free products [17,18]. Notwithstanding the technical challenges of substituting palm oil [19], it has recently been suggested that this strategy may potentially have adverse effects, given that lower-yielding oil crops require up to 10 times more land than oil palm to produce a given quantity of vegetable oil [14,20,21]. Whilst alternative oil crops may have a smaller environmental footprint per hectare than oil palm, their larger area requirements could imply that the total environmental impact associated with the production of one litre of vegetable oil is actually higher than for oil palm""

2) ""Updating the 2018 IUCN situation analysis on oil palm and biodiversity, the new study finds that oil palm now makes up around 40% of the current global vegetable oil supply despite occupying only around 5.5% of the total global oil crop area (between 21.5 and 23.4 million hectares). For comparison, soy for oil production is planted in an area of 125 million hectares, or almost 30% of oil crop area worldwide, while supplying 28% of the vegetable oil demand. Oil palm plantations have accounted for more than half of local deforestation in e.g. Malaysian Borneo in recent decades, but are estimated to contribute moderately to deforestation globally. No reliable data is available on the amount of deforestation other oils have caused.""

“When it comes to the end use, vegetable oils are mostly interchangeable – but they differ in how productive they are and in their impacts on the environment. For instance, average yields for oil palm per unit area are several times those of rapeseed, soy, groundnut, cotton, coconut or sunflower. This implies that, if palm oil continues to play a dominant role in overall oil production, an additional 35.7 million hectares of oil plantations could meet the projected demand in 2050. This would mean an 8% increase in land use. If on the other hand, the less productive soy were used to meet this demand, an additional 204 million hectares of tropical and subtropical land would be needed, or a 48% increase compared to now (!!!!)"", said Professor Douglas Sheil of the Norwegian University of Life Science, a co-author on the study.

---

 This factoid that other oils are more sustainable could be catastrophic for the environment. Well meaning people could be increasing environmental destruction by avoiding palm oil in favour of others.

Please, this misinformation should be rectified, otherwise environmental damage from oils will likely increase.

**The solution to be more sustainable is not to boycott it, rather to try to buy products that have a ""sustainably sourced palm oil"" certificate, over ones that dont. Statistically this will help make the consumption more sustainable.**

Boycotting it will make it less sustainable


And please, ideally read the entire sources, esp first one, and esp the conclusion and discussion, since they go in much more detail than i have covered here, and paint a more detailed picture on the pros and cons of palm oil, how to make production more sustainable.


This is what we can infer from the data we have right now. As the sources say however, we need more information to better tackle this entire thing w oils. But believing claims about how ""palm oil is the most horrible and boycotting it will help the environment"" are unsubstantiated, and appear to contradict available evidence.

60,CULT Food Science Establishes Global Cellular Agriculture Advisory Board,"There are two kinds of agricultural products derived from cell culture: acellular products and cellular products. Acellular products are made of organic molecules like proteins and fats and contain no cellular or living material in the final product. Cellular products are made of living or once-living cells. Products harvested from cell culture are exactly the same as those harvested from an animal; the only difference is how they are made.

&amp;#x200B;

Acellular animal-sourced foods (like milk) can be made without animals by using a microbe like yeast or bacteria. In the example of milk made with yeast, the yeast are altered by inserting into them the gene carrying the blueprints for casein, a milk protein. Since all cells read the same genetic code, the yeast, now carrying so-called recombinant DNA, makes casein identical to the casein cows make in their milk. Most cellular products exist in tissues. In cellular agriculture, tissues are made outside the body in a process called tissue engineering. Cells from a particular species and tissue type are assembled on a scaffold (to grow on) with serum (food for the cells to feed on while they grow) in an environment that promotes growth.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, tissue engineering is a relatively new scientific pursuit, with a focus on clinical applications such as growing skin for burn victims or organs for patients requiring organ transplantation. The focus is on the tissue having a biological function — in other words, the tissue-engineered organ needs to be able to work in a living person. While the science behind growing tissue for an organ transplant is similar to growing muscle tissue for food, both come with a set of very different considerations. For example, tissues for meat or leather do not need to work as an organ in someone’s body. Instead, meat needs to have a particular nutritional value, mouthfeel, or taste. Leather needs to have a certain strength, texture, or softness. All cellular agriculture products need to be made affordably — that means producing tissues at a scale much larger than what is required for patients requiring organ transplants.

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to their conventional counterparts, cellular agriculture products have fewer environmental impacts, a safer, purer product, and a more consistent supply. This is because the product is being produced in safe, sterile, controlled conditions. Cellular agriculture has the ability to design and tune what you are making. For instance, you could make meat with fewer saturated fats and more unsaturated fats, or you could make leather of different thicknesses. You could make milk without lactose, or eggs without cholesterol. Despite the benefits and opportunities presented by cellular agriculture, it remains an underfunded area of research.

&amp;#x200B;

Cult food science investment platform for cellular agriculture does not only acknowledge this, but is trying to actively change it. The company has just established a global cellular agriculture advisory board to guide the company’s pursuit of defendable cellular agriculture-focused intellectual property, patents and royalty streams.

&amp;#x200B;

They have assembled such a world class Advisory Board, all thought leaders in their respective areas of cellular agriculture, cell biology, pharmacology, biotechnology and alternative protein solutions. Dr. Paul Burridge is an esteemed pharmacologist who is currently conducting research around induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for the purpose of advancing cultivated meat. Rob Harris is a active- start-up advisor focused on bridging the gap between scientific possibility and commercially viable products in the field of cellular agriculture. Dr. Anjum Mullani an alumnus of Institut Pasteur, Paris’ Department of developmental and stem cell biology, animal biotechnology, molecular biology and cellular senescence. Dr. Mullani is focused on applying her diverse knowledge base to accelerate the advancement of cellular agriculture. That's not all, don't fret...Cult expects to add other members to the Advisory Board in due course, as appropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

The global factory farming and aquaculture crises are intensifying in real time, posing a major threat to the world as we know it. Cellular agriculture will be the solution and change we need. However we need to do our part by informing ourselves and investing green. Companies such as CULT Food science, have unprecedented exposure to the most innovative start-ups, private or early-stage cultivated meat and cultured dairy companies around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

They have leading revolutionary investees, and as soon as their IPO goes public $CULT, they will be changing the game for cellular agriculture. Do not take my advice as a financial advisor, I'm just here to spread awareness, and try to change our planet one investment at a time. Do your own research and be the change.",sustainability,1638893781

62,Why I Started to Make Every Day Earth Day,"In the spring of 2017, my fiancé and I relocated from Virginia to the state of Ohio in order for him to pursue a career opportunity. The two of us had grown up in Virginia and both of our families still reside there to this day, so this move was a large adjustment for us. We had become accustomed to all of the beautiful amenities that Virginia had to offer; we had access to mountains with the nearby Appalachian trail, the beach with Virginia Beach and Yorktown Beach, famous amusement parks such as Busch Gardens, and so much more. We had no idea what to expect from Ohio, except a significant decrease in the average temperature and an increase in snowfall. However, the climate and landscape of Virginia was not the only thing that we were longing for after the move.

It only took a few months of living in Ohio for us to feel homesick and miss being able to interact with our friends and family members on a daily basis. Of course we had the convenience of modern day technology which allowed us to call them, text them, and even FaceTime them—but virtual interactions are just not the same. One day on FaceTime with my fiancé’s six-year-old brother, Mike, I had an idea about other ways that we could stay in communication. I thought we could take a more old school approach, and asked him, “Would you want to be my pen-pal?” I saw his confused face just staring blankly back at me on the screen. Initially, I assumed that his camera had frozen, but really he just had no clue what a pen-pal was! After a short explanation of the definition, he eagerly agreed to write to me once a month. Of course this would require his Mom to assist him in reading my letters, writing his responses, and mailing his letters to me, so we had to get her on board as well. She agreed to help us in the process and I began to draft my first letter to him.

It took me a while to settle on a topic for my first letter to Mike. Keeping in mind that I have always had a fascination with nature and my go to activities always took place outdoors, I thought it would be a fun idea to create a nature based scavenger hunt. The two of us could complete the scavenger hunt in our respective states, me in Ohio and him in Virginia, and be able to compare our findings. The scavenger hunt was simple and required us to take a “nature walk” and try to locate various items along the way. The items had to match the requirements and characteristics outlined on the list. For example, one item had to be blue while another had to be rough. I had to be mindful of the attention span of a six-year-old boy, so there were only around eight items for us to find on the walk. I went out to a nearby park that same day and collected all eight items from the list. Some of my items included a sleek sheath stone from the Rocky River riverbed, a pastel blue chip from a crushed robin’s egg, a black and red speckled bird’s feather, and the star of the show—a four leaf clover. I delicately wrapped my bounty in a few layers of paper towel, slipped it into an envelope with proper postage, put the parcel in the mailbox, and eagerly waited for his reply.

After waiting a week for his letter to arrive, my anticipation had been building. I just could not wait to see what items he had collected and see how similar or different they were from my own. I used my index finger to break the seal on the envelope, being careful not the damage the natural goodies inside. I peeled back the flap of the envelope and peered inside. To my surprise, I did not see the organic materials I had expected to see like twigs and pebbles, but instead I saw a variety of synthetic materials such as a string of blue yarn, a crinkled M&amp;M’s wrapper, a piece of wrinkly newspaper, and a small shiny shard of glass. While he had successfully completed the scavenger hunt and checked off all of the required items, he had only included one natural item in the entirety of his collection: a singular dry brown leaf.

I was absolutely devastated that these were the items that his “nature walk” had resulted in. Seeing this collection of items impacted me in a way that I was not expecting it to. I began to think about the environment as a whole and I started to fear that our future generations, such as Mike’s generation, might not have access to nature in the same way that I did growing up. I want Mike to be able to experience the natural world just as I did, but I fear that human impact and pollution might not allow him to do so. This scavenger hunt situation was a wakeup call for me, and caused me to analyze my own contribution to the poor condition and outlook of our environment. I researched the various agencies responsible for creating laws to protect the environment, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the systems we currently have in place to minimize human impact. I did not feel that these were adequate and it got me thinking, what can we do as individuals to make an impact? I believe that we have a responsibility to take care of our environment and ensure that we protect it for our future generations through environmental preservation and conservation. This was when I truly became passionate about protecting the environment.

From then on I made small adjustments to my daily living to help reduce my contribution to environmental pollution. I switched to reusable cotton pads, I purchased a set of reusable portable utensils, and stopped using paper towels and disposable water bottles. I vowed to monitor my usage of electricity and water, making sure to turn off light switches and faucets if I was not actively using them. I also decided to try to car pool or make use of public transportation whenever possible. While these changes may seem small or insignificant in the grand scheme of things, it is important to remember that every little bit helps. I believe that we each have a responsibility to do our part to protect and preserve the environment. If we don’t, what will that mean for Mike’s generation or the generation after him? In my next letter to Mike, I explained the meaning and importance of environmental preservation and conservation, and included a check-list of all of the day to day changes he could make to help do his part. I took this opportunity to change my own actions and to teach Mike about the consequences his own actions can have on the world. I managed to take this unfortunate situation and give it a positive outcome.

I encourage each of you reading this to take the time to analyze your own contributions to our current environmental dilemmas and look for ways to both reduce your negative impacts and increase your positive impacts. This might be in the form of actively volunteering for or donating to environmental renewal projects in your community, while in other cases it might be simply picking up a piece of trash you come across on the beach, turning off the lights/water when not actively using them, sorting your waste for landfill items vs. recyclable items, or carpooling to work to reduce emissions. It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that these small acts will not make an impact on the overall situation, but in reality, these small efforts can and do have a huge impact. Living a greener and more environmentally conscious lifestyle could have a ripple effect leading others to follow in your footsteps. We can make a difference and I feel that we have an obligation to try. What part will you play in this issue and what will you do to make a positive change?

**TL;DR** I created a nature based scavenger hunt for me and my young relative to complete. We had to find items that matched certain descriptions like: something blue or something rough. I found natural items such as rocks, leaves, and feathers while he found synthetic items such as yarn, wrappers, and newspaper. This made me fear for his generation and forced me to recognize the need for environmental protection and conservation. I made changes in my own life and encourage readers to do the same. How can we work both individually and collectively to combat this issue?",sustainability,1638878204

96,A sustainability success story - Blue Friday,"Hey everyone! I just wanted to share some happy news with y'all :) The past few years, a few small Canadian west coast businesses started a campaign around black Friday called blue Friday. Essentially they pledge to donate proceeds from Nov 26th (Black Friday) towards ocean conservation initiatives on the west coast of Canada. The last two years they raised money to install several sea bins (which are basically trash collectors for the ocean)! This year they had a goal of raising $12,000 to replace a ESP foam doc in Tofino that created a lot of the plastic debris that ended up in the seabins. 

  
This year over 20 brands came together to put sales proceeds towards ocean conservation and together they raised $40,000!! Thats almost 4x their goal. This is just an example of the amazing people in the world working so hard to protect nature &lt;3 Hope this story makes you smile!

Unfortunately I’ve had a heck of a time trying to find any winter wear that could survive Canadian winters that doesn’t have polyester in some form.

I’ve also looked at offerings from Fjallraven and waxed cotton coats from [Barbour](https://www.barbour.com/us/womens/view-all-womens?product_type=Waxed+Jackets) though most of these also use some form of polyester.

73,What do you want out of a sustainable product? Is $35 too cheap for this kind of product?,"Something isn't connecting with the consumers, we've gotten really great feedback on the product quality, but is it possible people don't trust our price point? We wanted to create something affordable and sustainable so we have really tight profit margins, which doesn't really allow us to advertise, a $10 CAC makes us unprofitable. 

For Sustainability reference:  our cotton is in the top 1% of organic cotton, it's grown within 100km of the mill that processes it, turns it into our textiles, and passes it along to our dye house. This allows us to maintain incredibly low CO2 emissions through this process. Our dye house holds over a dozen environmental and human rights certifications. They also use some of the most advanced technology in the industry that allows for our dying process to use 1/10th of the dye that the process traditionally entails. Then we spend 30 days cleaning the water then send it back to the farm for ag usage. We even catch the steam created in the process. Six water bottles go into the polyester used in the shirt, the mailer bags are reusable, we even take very careful attention to the CO2 used in the shipping process, and ultimately we have a carbon positive process. Our goal is to show people this needs to be the standard(bare minimum) all clothing manufacturers are held to. We don't think that message will resonate at a $70 price point.

And this is tied to the big lie that Columbus somehow made it to America first (which he didn't) and 'discovered' the US which happened to have thousands living well, happily and sustainably.  And the so-called hero cowboys that were basically dumb-ass rednecks (likely modern day Trumpers) killed every Native American that they could find that did not conform to European traditions.  And lastly, we killed countless numbers of buffalo which had sustained the native residents for hundreds of years before being discovered.  And in true American style we gloss over these hard truths and instead rationalize this Holiday as giving thanks to those we care about.  And of course, to add insult to injury, the day after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year.  So we might think of Thanksgiving as the Anti-Earth Day or Unsustainable Thursday.  Wow - I just went off on a big tangent!  Happy Thanksgiving  (sorry)...gulp",sustainability,1637795081

* **Supporting people** 🤝: rainforests are home to 350 million people around the tropics.​
* **Rich biodiversity** 🐞: rainforest are home to millions to species. We lose 50,000 species per year due to deforestation, lets help protect them.​
* **Carbon sequestration** 🌎: the planet’s rainforest are capable of providing 23% of the climate mitigation needed before 2030.​
* **Fertile soils** 🌱: A single spoonful of soil in the rainforest contains 10,000 to 50,000 different types of bacteria and supports millions of species of fungi, plant and animal.​

​

Keeping the rainforest standing is the simplest and cheapest way to mitigate climate change. ​

Every year, billions of sardines move north along this unspoiled coastline, attracting and sustaining sharks, dolphins, sailfish, whales and other marine life. Now, in the wake of the COP26 climate conference where leaders agreed on the urgent need for action, a seismic survey of the area is about to begin in hopes of finding new oil and gas deposits under the seafloor. Beyond the immediate damage caused to marine life by the destructive and incredibly loud seismic air guns, the exploitation of further fossil fuel reserves in an environmentally sensitive area goes against all common sense when considering the intertwined climate and biodiversity crises.

Together with eyeforce OceansNotOil, parley.tv and sentinelocean, Ocean Collective documented the arrival of Shell’s survey ship and will support raising awareness and local efforts in the upcoming weeks.

What does a seismic survey look like?

For the next 5 months every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the vessel is firing loud shock waves into the sea bed which could have detrimental effects on one of the most beautiful marine ecosystems in the country.

61,CULT Food Science (CSE: CULT) Leads Seed Investment Round for Celebrity Brendan Brazier’s Fiction Foods,"Happy Tuesday ladies and gents.  For those that haven’t yet heard the news, Cult Food Science has emerged as the sole strategic investor in Fiction Food LLC’s seed round.  So what's the big deal? Fiction Foods is another disruptive player entering the foodtech space.  In a nutshell, it leverages emerging technology to help construct a transparent, intelligently designed, nutritionally-superior and smarter food system at a lower environmental cost than what is currently available. Built upon a data-driven approach to product construction, Fiction Foods has the goal of obtaining more nutrients (proteins, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytochemicals) while consuming less of each natural resource (land, water, fossil fuel). They call this the Nutrient to-Resource Ratio, and it is their “north star”. 

&amp;#x200B;

The founder of this amazing company is none other than Brendan Brazier. Co-developer of Beyond Meat’s (BYND) “Beast Burger”, and co-founder of Vega (VEGA). BYND is currently valued at $5B, and Vega was acquired in 2015 by WhiteWave Foods Company for US$550 million, representing one of the most successful cash exits in the nascent years of the plant-based industry.  So in other words, Mr. Brazier has a proven track record of success for getting disruptive alt-food companies off the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

As we’ve seen over the past month, Cult Food Science has been strategically investing in a number of cellular agriculture companies such as Melibeo (bee-free honey), which was recently named as one of TIME magazine's top 100 inventions of the year, and not to forget as well as investing in 3D bio-tech. Dovetailing nicely with this larger trend, Fiction Food’s corporate concept and strategy is a perfect fit with high growth-potential for CULT’s expanding portfolio of investee companies in the cellular agriculture space.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering Brenda Brazier's astronomical success with previous (similar) ventures, my assessment is that Fiction Foods clearly has serious potential to make a name for itself in this burgeoning field. For impact/food-tech investors interested in global food security and alternatives to the factory food/meat industry, CULT’s recent strategic investment into Fiction Foods is precisely the type of bullish indicator one would hope to see before the former’s imminent IPO.  Keep an eye out, DYOR, and this should not be construed as financial advice.  Trade responsibly folks!",sustainability,1637679121

Now here is where my dilemma begins, I have been looking into better alternatives to my current detergent and dishwasher pods and I’m almost done using both of them up, I was interested in ordering Dropps brand and have heard lots of great reviews but I saw on grove that their brand has an similar product, the reviews on their website were good but I’m wondering if they genuinely are good at stain removal, I have three kids so I need stain fighting POWER (which is why I still serve the devil aka tide) would love some insight because I know dropps and grove have offfset their shipping but I don’t want to have multiple subscriptions if I can help it.",sustainability,1637549438

26,The r/law subreddit supporting Chevron (the oil company) proves exactly why oil companies never face legal action,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/pzfaju/lawyer\_steven\_donziger\_gets\_sixmonth\_sentence\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/pzfaju/lawyer_steven_donziger_gets_sixmonth_sentence_for/)

For those who have not heard of this legal case, Steven Donziger was a lawyer who fought against Chevron after Chevron was found polluting Ecuador in every way possible. Chevron then used every trick in the book to frame the situation as Donziger being the corrupt one, and Chevron having done nothing wrong. This includes bribing judges, fabricating evidence against Donziger, etc. 

It is super clear that Chevron is the one who is in the wrong, yet people in the law subreddit (read the comments on the thread I linked), many of whom I assume do work in law or are aspiring to enter the field, are saying that Donziger is wrong because he refused to give up his electronic devices to be searched, and that Donziger violated terms and conditions that a lawyer shouldn't, etc. However, that's like saying me saving a person from dying (analogy for defending a country from oil pollution) is illegal, because I crossed the street illegally to save the person (analogy for Donziger not complying with how a lawyer should behave). 

Donziger is an example of an ethical lawyer but almost every other lawyer seems to hate him. This proves that most lawyers like to play devil's advocate for oil companies, which is exactly why oil companies almost never face legal action. Bribing by the oil companies is a big part of it, but I'm sure the law subreddit commenters are not paid by any company, meaning that even without bribes, lawyers tend to be biased towards big oil. I'm not saying every single lawyer except for Donziger is unethical, I'm saying that in general, they care too much about technicalities (focusing on what Donziger did wrong as a lawyer) rather than the big picture (the fact the Donziger is fighting an important cause). 

I clicked on the profile of one of those who commented in that thread. His comment and post history is very far-right wing. [https://www.reddit.com/user/Fun-Transition-5080/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fun-Transition-5080/)",sustainability,1637343226

Sophia is a M.A. candidate in the Sustainable Tourism program at the Patel College of Global Sustainability. From her time in the program, she has been trained in innovative tourism interpretation technologies like the Matterport 360 3D Camera. Some of her projects have included promoting and preserving Egmont Key and other local initiatives to align and implement the SDGs within Tampa Bay. Sophia's goal is to apply her collective knowledge from her internships to fight single-use plastics with Oceana, encourage Agritourism with Fat Beet Farm, and help the SDG Action Alliance to connect the hearts and minds of Tampa Bay residents and visitors with the SDGs.  


Samantha Vorce is a MA candidate in the Sustainable Tourism program at the Patel College of Global Sustainability (PCGS). She also has a certificate in Food Sustainability and Security from PCGS. Samantha hopes to work in environmental injustice in the tourism industry and in food insecure communities. She has worked with The Coalition of Community Gardens of Tampa Bay, Rosebud Continuum (an agriculture education center), and the Egmont Key Alliance. She has experience in social media planning, Matterport digital technology, Intuiface Software, and interpretation training. Through Samantha’s work with the SDG Action Alliance she will continue to use Matterport virtualization technologies to interpret natural and cultural assets at Egmont Key and beyond.

[https://vimeo.com/webinars/events/feeb08e5-f3d9-4b1f-aef5-c4c4c89f73f1](https://vimeo.com/webinars/events/feeb08e5-f3d9-4b1f-aef5-c4c4c89f73f1)  


Sophia is a M.A. candidate in the Sustainable Tourism program at the Patel College of Global Sustainability. From her time in the program, she has been trained in innovative tourism interpretation technologies like the Matterport 360 3D Camera. Some of her projects have included promoting and preserving Egmont Key and other local initiatives to align and implement the SDGs within Tampa Bay. Sophia's goal is to apply her collective knowledge from her internships to fight single-use plastics with Oceana, encourage Agritourism with Fat Beet Farm, and help the SDG Action Alliance to connect the hearts and minds of Tampa Bay residents and visitors with the SDGs.  


Samantha Vorce is a MA candidate in the Sustainable Tourism program at the Patel College of Global Sustainability (PCGS). She also has a certificate in Food Sustainability and Security from PCGS. Samantha hopes to work in environmental injustice in the tourism industry and in food insecure communities. She has worked with The Coalition of Community Gardens of Tampa Bay, Rosebud Continuum (an agriculture education center), and the Egmont Key Alliance. She has experience in social media planning, Matterport digital technology, Intuiface Software, and interpretation training. Through Samantha’s work with the SDG Action Alliance she will continue to use Matterport virtualization technologies to interpret natural and cultural assets at Egmont Key and beyond.

47,A couple of questions since I’m new to sustainability.,"I’m very new to the concept of sustainable living, something I’ll be trying to do once I move out. I have a couple of questions, though, and here they are:

* Where should I go for local purchases? Common products I tend to purchase are Morning Stat Farms, Beyond Meat, and Gardein. Oftentimes, I get these from Kroger (I currently live in Louisville, KY), although I’d like to know if they can be found in local shops).
* Does Kroger count as a local business? One thing I do remember from my time working at a Kroger myself is that one of the deductions from my paycheck was “Union Dues,” which led me to believe Kroger was part of a worker’s union and/or was a local business (due to being family-owned).
* For those that aren’t vegan (not that I’m that concerned), how do you get non-vegan products in more sustainable ways? Do you get them from a local farmer’s market?
* What are some general tips you can give for more sustainable living? I try not to purchase animal products intentionally.
* Does this count as a leftist subreddit? Part of this sub’s MO is taking a stand against mass environmental damage at the hands of capitalism, leading me to believe it’s a leftist group. On the other hand, what may prevent a right-wing person from participating in discussions on this sub? Can they still be part of the sustainability movement?
* How do you try to live sustainably, yet affordably (on a roughly $20k to $50k salary)?
* If I still have meat in a family’s house that no one is eating, yet I never paid for, should I eat it over throwing it away? Should I simply give it to some other people, preferably poor/hungry people?

52,Sustainability can already be achieved today with many products,"As an engineer I always check the products I buy on their sustainability. In contrary to all the statement from companies, sustainability can be achieved very easy with every product. An products developed 30-40 years ago can be rated as more sustainable than products today. Just because those days the buyer wanted a product which is robust, lasts as long as possible and is repairable.

Today the focus is on cheap products - in short term. Let's get the example of a toaster I saw which was sold in the 1960s. The job it did was the same as a toaster today - zoasting the bread. Not better or worse than a toaster today. It was almost completely made of steel and thpugh it was almost impossible to damage it.

Look at a toaster today. A lot of plastics, even electronic parts, which get damaged by time due to the heat of a toaster - a very natural thing. These models will only last a few years. So companies produce waste, not new products, and we don't take care of this. Because the waste product costs 1$ less....",sustainability,1636651833

57,[Paid academic study] Have you tried meat replacements/alternatives on several occasions? (US 18+),"Hi all, I'm doing my PhD thesis on motivating sustainable and alternative meat consumption and am looking for volunteers in the U.S. to participate in a study about motivations, skills, environments, and lifestyles in relation to alternative protein consumption. The research involves completing a 7-day photographic food diary and a 60-minute interview discussion. Interviews will take place online from November 22nd–26th 2021, at a time convenient to you, and be audio recorded for transcription purposes. A valid email address is required for research communication purposes.

To be eligible for the study you must:

* Reside in the U.S. and be aged 18 years or older
* Be comfortable sharing and discussing details related to your food habits and consumption
* In the last two weeks, made a protein purchase of either:
   * a)	farmed meat (e.g., beef, fish, chicken, etc.); or
   * b)	alternative proteins (e.g., faux meat, Quorn, edible insects)
* And are required to either:
   * a)	Consume alternative proteins on a regular basis (at least monthly); or,
   * b)	Have tried consuming alternative proteins more than once but do not currently do so on a regular basis

Your participation in this study will help us to understand how consumption of alternative proteins takes place in daily lives and routines, and how to further motivate sustainable protein consumption. To thank you for your time, you will receive a $50 US Amazon eGift card. Places in the study are filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

Potential activists currently orbit creators in endlessly fragmented communities on platforms with a direct incentive to hamper the growth of populist ideas.

Effectively organizing the left means we need a meta-platform for groups of all sizes, designed for content creators to funnel frustrated people into real local activism work. That work gets coordinated nationally by existing humanitarian groups once those currently disparate organizations have a positive space to collaborate.

I’m calling it humanitaria (follow progress over at /r/humanitaria) and its built around a visual map, with profiles like twitter, communities like discord, and topic pages like reddit. It connects groups/individuals near one-another with matching ideology, then encourages organizing/community building.

71,How can the future be a succes? We are looking for people who are working with children and want to participate a worldwide project creating free bilingual picturebooks from children for children," Hello all. We - the book pirates from Lübeck - have an idea that we think fits perfectly into this forum.

We are planning a multilingual handbook by children for children with the title ""How can the future be a success"". For this purpose, we provide a short story to people who work with groups of children. This story helps children to reflect on the people they know who give them hope for a successful future and to portray these people. We collect the answers and groups of children then illustrate the portraits. After this we want to publish the texts and illustrations in one or more multilingual picture books, which can be downloaded for free at [www.bilingual-picturebooks.org](http://www.bilingual-picturebooks.org/).

To enable as many children as possible to participate worldwide, we have translated the document with the project idea and the story for the children into seven languages. You can find them here: [https://www.bilingual-picturebooks.org/en/wie-kann-zukunft-gelingen\_projektstart](https://www.bilingual-picturebooks.org/en/wie-kann-zukunft-gelingen_projektstart)

We would be very happy if you take the time to read it briefly and distribute it to people who work with groups of children. We hope that this way - thanks to a look through children's eyes - we can also see how we can make the future a little bit better.",sustainability,1636543934

Saudi Arabia has pledged Carbon Neutrality by 2060. Here's what Saudi Arabia is doing to reach this objective:

* **Saudi Arabia is adopting Carbon Capture technology**, which basically means that all carbon emissions from oil production will be captured (it won’t go into the air) and used as energy or in the production of other materials. This will result in a cleaner environment.
* **Saudi Arabia is set to export energy from renewables, be that solar, wind or hydrogen fuel.** The country enjoys one of the world’s best locations for renewables such as wind and solar. The country is currently building the world’s largest solar plants, wind plants and hydrogen fuel plants.
* **Saudi Arabia launched the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative**, which aim to plant more than 10 billion trees in Saudi Arabia and 50 billion trees in the Middle East. This will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the Middle East by 60%.",sustainability,1636531783

In 2020 VT passed a law that banned food scraps from the trash and banned single use plastics (no more plastic bags at the grocery store, no more plastic straws, etc.). Before this went into effect, I always brought my own reusable bags to the grocery store and whenever I needed to go out shopping. 

I have been in MI for just over a month now and my anxiety and stress feels like it's through the roof. The looks I receive for bringing my own bags into a store or saying no to a plastic bag has really started to get to me. I am also taken aback about how many fast food chains there are. Where I am from I had to drive at least 40 minutes to get to get to an area to do shopping and now it's &lt;10. I feel myself becoming unhappier and angier the longer I stay, and I am really considering moving back home.

And to be honest, I don't know that we (as a company) are really doing anything to make sure that our advocacy helps LMI or historically marginalized communities. I have not included any such statements in my educational talks or presentations, and that feels even worse.

1- Anyone have suggestions on good resources to educate myself and hopefully others on the history and what we should be doing to address climate change from a racial justice perspective? 

2- Has anyone had experience trying to stop your peers/boss from preaching values that they don't practice?

41,Sustainable Natural Latex,"Global warming is real and for many of us who cares about earth for our next generation is always looking for eco-friendly alternatives. From the food we consume, to the vehicle we drive and even to the beds we sleep in. If you're a greenie looking looking for new beds, you must consider latex. Natural latex mattress has gained popularity as the green alternative to Memory Foam but many are still unsure by how much. This article looks into the life cycle of Natural Latex Foam, it will help you make an educated choice when selecting your bed.

A natural latex mattress starts its journey from Hevea Brasiliensis, the rubber tree. This species produce the most latex a year but it needs 6 years to mature before harvesting. When harvesting begins, farmers could only collect 100g of natural latex from a tree every 2 days. This means it takes 12 acres of harvest to make a queen size mattress. More latex mattresses means more trees.

Unlike logging, rubber trees are not harmed when tapped for latex. It only takes a shallow 6mm cut on the tree bark for latex to flow and latex can be collected for hours. Furthermore, rubber tappers will rotate the locations they tap, allowing the trees to heal, an art the farmers perfected through many generations of farming and harvesting. Truly sustainable. 

Besides not harming the trees, 12 acres of green can help to remove 143 tons of carbon dioxide every year. So buying natural latex would actually have a positive impact to our environment because acres and acres of rubber trees will be planted for farmers to meet our demands. Making natural latex truly green, sustainable and renewable.

Rubber latex products has been around for 100 years now and it's a real gift from nature. But because harvesting is slow, its price is higher compared to fossil fuel petrochemical foams like Memory or PU Foams. Its CO2 vs $, which price would you pay?

Interested to compare Latex vs Memory Foam? Read this [article](https://www.liliamber.com.au/blogs/know-your-mattress/why-latex). Ready to get yourself one? Buy from [Lili &amp; Amber](https://lili-and-amber.myshopify.com/www.liliamber.com.au).",sustainability,1636088925

61,Research - Short survey on a mobile bulk store prototype,"Hi all, 😀

Students from the University of New South Wales are currently working on a prototype to reducing waste pollution and we have come up with an idea that would facilitate people in carrying out a zero waste lifestyle. 

We would like to kindly request you to complete a short survey on a prototype we are working on.

Our prototype is a mobile bulk store. Imagine a food truck, but instead, it provides you with refill services for common household products such as laundry detergent, dish soap, shampoo, cleaning solutions, etc. Other dry goods such as rice, beans, pasta, could also be provided. 

The truck would go around neighbourhoods on a weekly scheduled basis and customers could come up to the truck with their containers, and refill it with whatever products they may need. This reduces the inconvenience of hauling out different containers to a bulk store and transporting it all the way back home. 

It is our hope that this prototype could be a viable solution in helping communities reduce unnecessary plastic waste. 

We understand that some may have questions or concerns. Please feel free to comment down below or ask your questions in the survey. 

Response will be anonymous. 

Thank you for your kind participation 🤗

It introduces the water drinking problem, which desalination can be used to solve the issue. But with desalination, energy and chemical use are challenges for further adoption. The assignment then asks to pick 

1. (Renewable) energy sources for desalination: technologies using waste heat from industries or  

solar power 

2. Chemical usage in desalination technologies: environmental impact and possible alternatives 

I am not sure where to go with either of these directions based on the assignment description since I am not sure if I have to taken into account both energy and chemical issue into one of these options. I asked my profs but they havent replied for weeks..

Anyways, if i decide to go with second option, I am wondering what is potential research can be done for writing a paper on.

Every day we wake up and go on about our normal lives, often times without realizing just how lucky and beautiful the world we live in truly is. Every single person has the opportunity to have their own experience living in this world. We are lucky to live in a world where we get to share it with wildlife, hear the sounds of rivers flowing and ocean waves, get to swim in lakes and climb mountains. Sometimes we forget to take a moment to stop and appreciate everything the world has offered us. 

The world is constantly evolving and changing. Everyone who lives upon this planet leaves a carbon footprint in this world. We use many of the earth's natural resources to do our daily activities from day to day. We use gas for our cars, stoves and indoor fireplaces. The gas we use for these functions causes chemicals to be released into the air and contributes to air pollution.  We also use water clean water in our houses for cooking, washing our hands, showers and drinking. Not everyone in the world is fortunate enough to have clean water to use. Electricity is used in houses and buildings, which uses up coal, oil, natural gas and more. This also contributes to light pollution. 

Over time the amount of resources being used on a daily basis adds up quickly in a world of over 7 billion people, which also means the pollution continues to get worse. Climate change and global warming are also in result of these factors in more. The planet is our home and it's important to think about ways to protect it and how we can effectively use their resources and think of ways in our daily lives to produce less waste and pollution.

First, is frustrating because no; even tho corporations suck, we still have power as consumers to demand them to go better, and to choose safer options (at least you can do it in middle class- rich countries, and let's just focus on the people who can act). And second, is such a big fat lie. I become vegetarian in 2006 and all i heard was how useless that choice was. I was only 14, and it was really exhausting to hear that always, but time showed how quitting meat could actually make a difference, and we can see it now with the rising on veganism and animal advocacy.

The cultivation of Cannabis sativa Lin. employs a variety of rootzone systems, yet little is understood about the potential for aquaponics systems.

Progressively, it is a more sustainable system amid the energy and resource-demanding conventional environments albeit in very slim usage. Here's a clip from a few years ago outlining how aquaponics works for the cultivation of Cannabis. And in the links that follow some peer-reviewed publications that describe in much more detail using empirical data!

The environment is much more ""ecosystem"" level with intricate food webs of fish (nile tilapia), nitrifying bacterium, and plants; with interesting biogeochemical wet and dry rootzones.

25,When did we realize the impact we have on earth?,"So i have a small question which is rather difficult to answer properly. I was wondering when did people realize that humans can negatively impact the earth very negatively, e.g. Climate change? When did the majority of people realize their way of living is not sustainable?

For example, acid rain made people realize they should adress car exhaust pollution, but was the general consensus that acid rain could cause large problems for humans in the long term like climate change does?

So basically, at what point in time did people realize that something about their way of living had to change, or else there would be large negative consequences?",sustainability,1635689525

27,The scale of the change needed is huge,"Not sure what the point of this post is and this is probably going to sound pretty daft but I think I only really realised today how huge the changes we need to make are. I was thinking about COP26 and the 1.5C warming target and found [this article](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-design/15-degree-lifestyles) which is based on a report stating discussing how individuals' carbon footprints need to reduce to meet the 1.5C target... basically the TLDR is that the average individual carbon footprint needs to be 2.5 (tCO2e) by 2030 in order to meet the 1.5C target.

I would consider myself pretty green, I probably do 90% of the common things recommended to cut your environmental impact, but when I entered some detail about my own lifestyle into a carbon footprint calculator it came out as 9 tonnes of emissions per year.

I know personal carbon footprints aren't the be-all-and-end-all and that there needs to be a load of other changes put in place to regulate industry, and improve housing and transport infrastructure etc etc etc but it really shocked me how far off I personally am from the where we need to be.",sustainability,1635688897

31,Trying to convince my boss to start thinking about sustainability and I need your help: Which companies do it right?,"Hi all, I work for a small-ish (100 employees) company that makes hardware that is used in the development process in the embedded electronics industry, mainly in the automotive industry. I'm trying to push efforts for our company to become more sustainable and environmentally and socially responsible, and while my boss is not entirely unsympathetic to the cause, he is taking a tough negotiating stance and will not agree to anything unless I can show that at least some other companies (preferably in our industry) are adopting similar measures to what I'm proposing. I also pointed out to him that we do already tick some of the sustainability boxes, like having in-house manufacturing instead of outsourcing it, sourcing local components, and minimizing plastics in our products, and I feel like we should communicate this  clearly to our customers, both in terms of what we already do right, and what we are committed to improve. His response was again that I have to show him how other companies communicate this, to give us an idea of what that entails.

So, what I ask from you is any info and resources on these two topics:

* Examples of companies (preferably in the automotive or tech industry) that ""do it right"", that are either already very sustainable or environmentally friendly, or have adopted very thorough plans on how to get there
   * I  can find tons of examples like [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/) where the company is built on the foundation of sustainability, and while that's probably still a useful reference (it shows that ""sustainable"" does not negate ""economically viable""), I'm more interested in ""regular"" companies that changed course or adopted significant measures, since that's most applicable to us at this point
* Examples of sustainability PR and marketing material (webpages, flyers, videos) from companies that ""tick all the boxes"" in your opinion. By which I mean companies that make it clear what their goals and priorities are, don't try to greenwash without any concrete commitments, and ideally do this in a very straightforward way
   * I found [Tesla's report](https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/2020-tesla-impact-report.pdf) quite good in terms of content and showing actual data, but it is loooong and unwieldy, and they don't provide any short summary or anything. I also like [Infineon's webpage](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/sustainability/) (we do a lot of business with them), though you do have to click through lots of subpages, but it's concise, straight-to-the-point, and backs their claims by actual certificates from third-party evaluation bodies. However, we can't afford the overhead of an independent certification at this point, so Infineon's approach also isn't entirely applicable for our company at this point in time.

Greenwashing and bogus empty language is also something we'll have to be careful with, so if you know of any particularly bad examples, those would be much appreciated as well.

Thank you so much in advance for any responses, I think this is a good opportunity for me to do my part in making the world a more sustainable place to live and work, and I'm trying to do the best job I can to convince management that we should do something about it. So having your help might be the drop over the edge that I need to make some actual change happen in our company.",sustainability,1635642623

I spoke to a relative a couple of days ago and they ended up saying I was being pessimistic and cynical. I don't even remember how we got onto this topic but at some point they asked me something and I mentioned how messed up the planet is, with political tension all over the globe, poverty, societal issues, pollution, global warming and especially consumerism. I said something about how at this point there's probably nothing anyone can do, the planet is just going to decline because too many people are unwilling to give up what they consider to be comfortable. 


He argued that there a bunch of independent companies  working to change for example water pollution, reducing microplastics in the sea. I said it doesn't matter, there needs to be more people, especially people in power, who actively want to make a difference. 


I ended up getting pretty upset because he was essentially saying I'm acting like a ""woke Greta"" and that I need to stop listening to the ""emotional manipulation"" that's being put out.

69,One of my pet peeves about sustainable fashion-my opinion,"I only purchase cotton clothing and actually cannot tolerate wearing other materials like polyester for example. I've been like this for well over a decade already. I do find cotton clothing in mainstream stores and often find organic cotton in stores like Jcrew. My golden rule for clothing is that I never pay more than $25 per article like a skirt, pants, dress and under $15 for tops, tees etc. I find great stuff on sale or clearance racks, and only buy stuff that I know I'll get a lot of use of for a long time. I like to think that I'm succeeding at being sustainable when it comes to fashion.

However, I recently came across a brand on social media which seemed to have a great cause behind it including them advocating for sustainability. Their items were 100% cotton and looked very fashionable. The problem for me: the price of their items was over $250.  

Now, it's obviously a personal choice on how much people choose to spend on clothing.  But shouldn't sustainable fashion be affordable as well? If we're so passionate about sustainability, shouldn't we want it accessible for all, not only the rich who are willing or able to spend that much on clothing? It just felt very hypocritical to me.

18,Must the fossil fuel industry end to save the planet?,"Hi guys,

Firstly, just wanted to preface this is not my position, I am asking this from the perspective of those who believe otherwise. Let me explain:

Some people think we can save the planet by going ‘net zero’ meaning instead of actually ending the fossil industry, we instead have machines that suck the carbon out of the air and sell it back to people as fuel. Thus, when scaled up, we will end up having net zero i.e. a scenario where fossil fuel can exist so long as the carbon it emits is captured by these machines and we essentially create a ‘sustainable’ loop whereby no extra carbon is emitted.

What are your thoughts?

I have serious doubts about it personally.

Some people will die from the climate changing. But people die every day from lots of things. The problem will be there are too many people, living in places they shouldn't be.

Plenty of people live sustainable lives. They are also dirt poor and backwards. Think Amazonian tribes and Africans in mudhuts. They also never changed the world, they are losers.

The climate is changing because we are winning. Capitalism means we can go to the mall, get a Starbucks, drive home in a suv and watch the Bachelor with the air con on full blast on a hot and humid summer day.

The trick to capitalism is that nothing stands still. Either you are winning, or you are losing. In going ""green"", the biggest losers are the poor. The rich will push the the great reset agenda of ""own nothing and be happy"". That's rubbish. I want to own lots of things and be happy. Plus, I'll be dead in 50 years and so will most people I know.

Don't want anyone to suffer after you've gone? Stop having children. In the meantime, show your support for the fossil fuel industry, for the capitalist system that has given you the means to post on reddit like you are now.

""The position we have got ourselves into with the environment is analogous to looking at your bank account and seeing there is still £1,000 in it and spending it all, only to find out later that none of your bills had been paid by the bank and now you have to tighten your belt""

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer this to a credit card analogy as it implies a bit less blame so the listener won't immediately become defensive. I am trying to communicate the fact that essentially the late 20th century was an anomaly, the ""good times"" of every middle class household having multiple vehicles, cheap energy, cheap meat, creating as much waste as you want, was really just due to the fact that those things were priced below the real market value because all the externalities were not included in the price. So people aren't now being punished but they do have to return to a lifestyle where the full cost of their behaviour is accounted for and when you have had things so good for so long and you didn't think you were doing any harm, this feels like a punishment.

I have two nieces who are also studying computer science.

How can nuclear engineers can swear the new nuclear facilities are incredible safe, safe for what, the environment as we already know it?

63,Sustainable Savings Account,"Hi folks,

I've been working through my checklist of life changes to promote sustainability. Pretty proud of how far I've come over the last few years.

Any way, one of the last things to do is transfer my savings account over to a sustainably focused bank. I really enjoy the customer service and usability of chase (and have also been a Wells Fargo customer for years), but I'm sick of keeping my money with an institution that I know is funding investments that are anti-sustainability.

I've done some research, and kind of disappointed in what I've been able to find. If anyone has experience with these banks and can provide feedback (or other suggestions) I'd really appreciate it! I want my savings to work just like I am. I am NOT concerned about interest rates, transaction maximums, etc. I just want somewhere I can trust (both to use my money sustainably and that I won't be defrauded), has a good UI, and customer service I can speak with.  


* Aspiration - one of the first banks to focus on sustainability, as far as I know. They have a lot of great features and 22K reviews on Apple app store, but many of the reviews are so sad to hear and other searches online make me very cautious (basically, they freeze your account and there is no customer service to speak with)
* Atmos - Online they claim to invest only in sustainable investments. Overall seems good, but new company and very few reviews online
* Ando - same as Atmos. But, it does appear Alex Honnold vouches for them. I know.... not that big a deal but I love Honnold and trust him
* Bank of the West - claim to be sustainable and diverse. Large bank with history so I feel like I can trust them with my money. But, I've seen some concerning reviews about fraud and I'm not sure how much I can trust a big bank to be sustainable. I'm leaning towards West because of their history and size.",sustainability,1634249763

Guys. If there's one thing I know about the climate crisis it's this: it is very serious, someone, somewhere should be doing a lot about it and I am one hundred percent sure that whoever that person is, it isn't me. That's a thought absolutely everyone has! I have it, you probably have it, CEOs have it, politicians have it, absolutely everyone has that thought. The problem with these huge systems we all live in is that there is a diffusion of responsibility. One option is that everyone in the world takes responsibility for their little part and another is that everyone in the world plays a game of responsibility hot potato. No prizes for guessing which one humanity chose! ""Zara, you should take responsibility and pay a living wage across your supply chain"", we say, throwing the potato to them while picking up a pair of slacks. ""Oh, well, we tell our suppliers to behave! They sign a formal agreement!"", says Zara, throwing the potato to the suppliers. ""Well, if Zara paid us enough money we could afford to give people labour rights"" say the suppliers, throwing the potato back to Zara. ""Well, people don't want to pay that much for their clothes"" says Zara, throwing the potato back to the consumer. ""I'm too busy to think about stuff like this"" says the consumer...

My biggest aim in life is to have a problem solving attitude and sense of agency. There are certain associated advantages and disadvantages to those aims. The advantages are clear! The most important step in solving a problem is to try solutions! So if you try lots of solutions you eventually end up solving a few problems, even if the first solution isn't always the right one. The disadvantages are that sometimes you are terrible when people just need you to shut the fuck up and listen to how they feel rather than saying ""oh well, have you tried x, y and z"", which is a really annoying thing to say if someone just needs to be listened to. Another disadvantage is you get incredibly, incredibly frustrated by the climate crisis because it seems the whole thing is caused by an entire planet of people saying there are zero solutions to this massive problem and when you say ""hey well what about trying this partial solution?"" they say ""oh no, no, that will never work! China is doing very wrong things and also Amazon. Now stop being ridiculous and get out of my way, I have to throw this potato to the government.""

I'm very, very far from doing everything perfectly, but I at least aim to live a life that I think one could reasonably live and, if the big players actually did their job, the earth might be ok. In the imaginary world I created in my head, using a great deal of imagination, the governments have done all they can to install systems that reduce carbon emissions and in return the proletariat have changed their lifestyle to eliminate those emissions which the governments could not eliminate by installing existing technologies and regulating private business. Such a life involves eating mostly plants, so that’s what I do. There is nothing on the horizon that can possibly take care of our humongous meat problem. Such a life involves taking my own containers and produce bags to the grocer and deli and buying unpackaged food, so I do that as well. There is no other solution to that problem, because plastic recycling is a lie and unfettered paper consumption being sustainable is another lie. So I bring my own bags, no big deal. I also try to not buy items and if I really, really want something, I try to buy it second hand, because probably there is nothing the system can do to make the enormous amount of things we buy sustainable. So I buy as few new physical things as I can, no problemo. Such a life involves flying as little as possible so I take the train when I can, guiltily carbon offset when I can't and try to envision and work towards a life in which I don't need to fly. On the other hand, there is also a huge “system” going on, which I cannot fix and the only thing I can do about that is complain a lot to people who can do stuff about it and try to make sure my euros don’t feed it. So that’s what I do.

The thing that I want emphasise about this lifestyle is that the effort is largely front-loaded. It's like quitting cigarettes. You put in a big amount of effort for a couple of weeks or months and then it's just about not getting knocked off course. I spend a lot of my time thinking about the best way to convince people to just try, actually, because once people get over the mental hurdles of ""but I don't *want* to have to remember my keepcup"" or ""I don't *want* to adjust what I eat"" or ""I don't *want* to have to think about how much I drive"" they'll usually discover it's not so hard! I got on and off the horse for years, vegan for six months here, only buying second hand items for a year there and so on. I can say with confidence that the absolute hardest step is getting past your mind's defense system. It takes a huge effort to get over the thoughts of ""oh why should I have to do things when the developing countries are doing this and that and the government isn't doing such and such and Jeff Bezos exists and..."" But once you do it the first time it's like riding a bike! Sure maybe you fall off, but getting back on is not half as difficult as it was the first time.

Just because we take responsibility for our tiny bit doesn't mean that the big players will magically start taking responsibility for their huge bit. But the thing about hot potato is that if someone, anyone, just works up the courage to hold on to that potato then *the game is over*! If consumers say ""hey Inditex, we're not going to buy your shit anymore unless you get your act together"" then the game of hot potato is over and Inditex either stops this ridiculous greenwashing and actually gets its act together or Inditex goes bankrupt. Similarily, if people just stop eating so much meat and start eating beans instead of asking why the government keeps subsidising beef then *that* game of hot potato is over! The government will have to say ""god it appears that a big section of the population is no longer burger obsessed, maybe we can roll back the subsidies a bit and try for some points with these crazy tofu eaters?"" So just ask everyone you know to hold the potato! Ask your friends, ask your local supermarkets, ask your family, ask the EU, ask your local politicians, everyone! Shout at every single person or body you have access to ""please, the world is ending and we don't have time for this game anymore. Please just hang onto the potato!"" And 95% of the time the answer will be more or less ""fuck off"" and that's ok! Because 5% of the time people say ""by Jove, you're right! Shit, let's go. Hey everyone HANG ON TO YOUR POTATO!"" Did I take this metaphor too far? I think I pushed this one a bit. Anyway, hopefully the meaning is clear.",sustainability,1634224079

76,Individuals shifting blame to the companies?,"To start with; I live as sustainably as I allow myself, I fully support 

But I've noticed that there is the sentiment among green people that it is not the individuals, but the companies that are to blame for all the evil destruction around our planet, after all, they produce and pollute. Individuals sure can withdraw from using straws, but in general, their impact is minuscule. While companies shift the blame to individuals, individuals also shift the blame to companies.

This is something that I've never fully agreed with, instinctively I felt it off. Aren't companies in today's world merely a response to people's needs and perhaps a reflection of their ideals. 

Assuming a free market will do their thing; reducing your needs and changing habits will force the companies to reduce their production and change their products if they still want to stay afloat. If people decide to buy a sustainable product from a sustainably aware and open competitor the evil and polluting company will have to change their ways or lose money. This is a very long-run approach and requires a collective of individuals, social awareness. 

Obviously, the alternatives are not always there; someone in need of a cheap car would choose any car no matter how green the company producing it is. People with no access or no means to buy sustainable or recyclable products will buy other cheap replacements. 

I guess my view is a bit naively hopeful, but I've been wondering what is your view on this and perhaps show me something I don't see.",sustainability,1634209031

22,"""Electric cars will still create CO2 emissions"" is a fallacy","I've been discussing this a lot recently. Many people are of the opinion that electric cars still result in emissions, just elsewhere - instead of CO2 coming from the tailpipe of your car, it comes from a fossil fuel power plant.

While this is largely true *for now*, it is not necessarily true forever. As we move into the future, there's the possibility that we transition to fully renewable, zero-emission power generation. At that point, electric cars will actually have no correlated CO2 emissions. There are lots of caveats i could get into about this, but for the sake of clarity I wont.

The argument that electric cars result in comparable emissions to internal combustion engines (ICE) is a fallacy because it relies on the assumption that our power generation infrastructure will stay the same forever. There is no way an ICE will *ever* be zero emissions, but there is a decent chance that in the future, electric cars will be zero emissions.

Historically, we know that minority ethnic people have been unrepresented in the movement. My research aims to help explore how online tools could complement efforts to make the space more inclusive.

The interview should last 45-60 min. Upon completing the interview, you will receive a £10 voucher of your choice. I would really appreciate your help in participating in the study.

If you are interested, please read the following inclusion criteria in order to participate:

\- Identify themselves as part of one or more minority ethnic groups

*For the purpose of this study, we define minority ethnic groups as all minority ethnic groups other than White – Welsh, English, Scottish, Northern Irish, British, Irish, Italian, German, etc. This includes other White minority groups such as Gypsy, Roma, Irish Traveller.*

\- UK resident

\- Healthy adults (18 years old or above)

\- Have been to/thought about joining one or more in-person events that support sustainability/ the climate movements

\- Consider themselves engaging in actions that support the movement or fighting climate change

43,"here’s a bunch of ways ive thought of to be more sustainable, some of these may not apply to you if you’re tight on money or disabled and that’s ok!","- shop at second hand stores and yard sales


- ask around for things you need rather than getting it brand new


- compost food, paper scraps, and all of your compostable waste


- avoid online shopping as much as you can


- deactivate your amazon prime
subscription if you have one


- choose a longer shipping option if buying online, this reaps less havoc on the environment


- buy unpackaged food from the grocery store rather than plastic packaged


- shop from a local farmers market


- check ingredient labels for the word “palm” and try to avoid foods that contain it


- avoid highly processed foods and opt for whole foods or ingredient lists with only whole foods if able


- eat vegetarian or better yet, vegan


- make your own plant based milks rather than storebought if able 


- when buying fruits and veggies, take blemished food that people would not take. this helps to combat food waste, when produce looks bad at grocery stores it gets chucked


- *attempt, when able* to avoid supporting kraft, coca-cola, pesico, general mills, kellogs, wrigley, mars, unilever, johnson &amp;amp;amp;amp; johnson, P&amp;amp;amp;amp;G, and nestle. this is difficult as these companies own practically every large brand, but if you have idle time its often very easy to make your own items without supporting these corporations


- if you menstruaste use a diva cup if able (also as a commenter added, period panties or reusable pads are options as well)


- if you’re lucky there might be a bulk store within 20-30 mins of you, i shop at an incredibly stocked one called “honest weight food co op” in albany NY, they have everything under the sun. bulk molasses, maple syrup, 20 dif kinds of coffee, hemp protein powder, 15 dif kinds of kombucha, 25 different flours, every spice you could imagine, plantable seeds, empty pill capsules, bentonite clay, EVERYTHING

- buy shade grown coffee! typical coffee is now grown in the sun and is a leading cause of different types of pollution, deforestation, massive water usage, and cheap labor done by the global south. shade grown coffee, however, is the traditional way of growing coffee, these “farms” mimic forests and sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and taste so much better! here’s a great video about the disastrous effects typical coffee has: https://youtu.be/Dp8ol4RRRiA (this channel is amazing)

- if decaf is your thing and you like dates, save the seeds from dates, follow a simple recipe for date seed coffee. it tastes just like coffee, just a bit nuttier and sweeter, and has no trace of caffiene like decaf coffee does.

- make food at home more often

- if you’d like to go out to eat, support local establishments rather than chain restaurants


- dumpster diving baby. corporate stores that sell anything sometimes throw out hundreds of items a week for various reasons. you can often find food, clothes, and countless other items in these dumpsters, they are often bagged separately from trash and the items themselves are packaged, its not a gross thing like its often portrayed. you can bask in the luxury of enjoying products from large corporations without supporting them in any way, give these things out to people who need them for free, and stop these things from rotting in a landill. many people are able to avoid buying food entirely. for maximum luck keep track of where, what day and what time you were able to score. check out r/dumpsterdiving


- grow some crops! no matter where you live, you can grow plants or even build highly efficient garden, indoors or outdoors


- plant species that are native to your location to support the environment


- if you live on a property with a yard, you can designate your lawn as a certified national wildlife habitat by providing a few things for native species, here’s a link on how: https://bellevuewa.gov/sites/default/files/media/pdf_document/backyard_wildlife_habitat.pdf


- when eating out, eat in to avoid plastic takeout containers


- bring your own containers when eating out for leftovers, or keep some in your car at all times


- make your own products if able, stuff like toothpaste, deoderant, soap, makeup, etc


- ecobrick if you have the time! ecobricking is where you cut clean plastic up into pieces about half the size of your finger and shove the pieces in a hard soda bottle (sprite, gatorade bottle, no flimsy water bottles). with the back of a wooden spoon. it gets so dense its similar to a brick, you can drop it off at a location that accepts them or ship them off, these bricks are used to build furniture, houses and schools! or you can use these to build yourself


- download Too Good To Go, its a great app where places that sell food can give out food that wouldve gone in a landfill at the end of the day. these surprise bags usually go for $2-$5.


- if you are confident enough (or if you work at one of these places), you can go to any place that sells food near you, and ask if they throw out food at the end of the day. if they do you can ask to speak to the manager and tell them about the app Too Good To Go. food stores can list “bags” in any time frame that suits them for a discounted price. so they are still making a profit but simultaneously helping disadvantaged people by giving them fresh food at a heavily discounted price, instead of it going into the trash.",sustainability,1633920336

I’m at a sort of at a crossroads of discussing business environmental impact versus societal footprint. How can I go about discussing both in somewhat nonbiased manner. There is a controversial topic that comes up when discussing an individual's environmental footprint. Mainly that this concept was largely lobbied and sustained by fossil fuel industries like BP. Corporations do alot more harm to the environment than one individual can.  Is there a way I can somehow address this conflict on environmental impact. I have put my outline for reference.





•	Intro 
o	I have a passion for sustainability
o	I try to pursue a life of frugality and minimalism as best as I can
•	Thesis 
o	The reason why I want to pursue the Sustainable Enterprise program is because I would like adapt my knowledge of sustainability to practically apply it in corporate or small business setting. Environmental issues like climate change and resource exploitation make me worry about the direction we are headed in. Sustainability can lessen the mental and social burden
•	Body 1
o	I have learned a lot about climate change, green initiatives and figures about the destruction humans are wreaking on the Earth. While this knowledge maybe good for gaining an awareness in environmental issue, it doesn’t give people the solutions to take practical steps to truly start making progress on the threat from climate change. Businesses applying sustainability into their supply chain or operations would be a huge contributing factor in mitigating climate change.",sustainability,1633729455

We are Master's students at the University of Southern Denmark, taking interviews as part of our thesis to increase our understanding of how sustainable fashion products are consumed and experienced? We are looking for respondents who are particularly consumers of sustainable fashion products, and residing in Denmark, but it is perfectly fine if you are residents of other countries.  

The interview takes around 30 minutes. We will be trying to capture your thoughts and perspectives on being a sustainable consumer of fashion products.
If you are from the area of Copenhagen or Odense, it would be a pleasure to meet you in person over a coffee. We could otherwise meet online.
However, your participation will be a valuable addition to our research and findings could lead to a greater understanding of sustainable fashion products, which will eventually help in our master’s thesis. 
We promise, your responses to the questions will be kept confidential. 
If you are willing to participate please respond with a comment or message, then we will fix a day and time, and have the interview session over some coffee or snacks.

99,Making a switch to sustainability reporting,"Hello everyone. 

Am an architect (25 years old) from India. I’ve been designing buildings for over 3+ years. While I’ve known that buildings aren’t sustainable and question myself for taking up the career, I didn’t know how shift to do something else more meaningful. 

I recently came across GRI, GHG auditing and sustainability management. 

From what I understand, people with these qualifications can audit a company’s GHG emissions, process and methods and propose changes within the company to be more sustainable (be it service industry or manufacturing) 

So I’ve been reading online more about the standards like GRI and SASB and triple bottom lines. 

Once I came across this, I really want to make a shift to sustainability management but don’t know how and where to start. 

Should I apply for masters programs? Should I do some certification for GRI or SASB? Would that help me land some kind of consulting jobs? 

I am really looking for a mentor in the area. Please help me out!",sustainability,1633569083

Hey! I write a sustainability blog. Sometimes I post my blog posts here and everyone applauds and sometimes everyone hates them and they get removed by the mods, I'm not actually sure what the deciding factor is?

I've become suuuuper frustrated and snarky lately, I think due to ""activism burn out"" in a world that seems bizarrely apathetic. To counter that, I'm trying to focus on the nicer side of anti-consumption and what what you stand to gain by becoming sustainability focused rather than what you lose. Please enjoy!

36,What should the price of carbon be?,"So, I’m all for Team Carbon Pricing. I believe the climate crisis is basically a market failure caused by the negative externalities of carbon emissions (climate forcing as well as smog and other health effects) not being appropriately included in the price of coal, oil, etc. If we could make the price of a barrel of oil reflect the true costs, the market would take care of decarbonizing in the most efficient way possible. There are various ways to do this (carbon tax, cap and trade), but they accomplish the same basic task.

I also understand that carbon isn’t priced correctly due to lack of political will. From oil lobbying,  to popular opposition such as the Yellow Vest protests, to lack of international consensus— there are massive barriers to appropriate carbon pricing.

If we look past the practical issues though, there is another question that I don’t know the answer to. What is the appropriate price for carbon? There must be economists who have looked into this and developed an estimate for what a barrel of oil should cost to account for the current and future environmental impacts.

46,Japan's Sustainable Travel &amp; Tourism Challenge is Identifying the Need for It,"I've been thinking a lot about future-travel and the role of sustainable travel in Japan over this last year as we don't want to go back to travel-as-usual, we want to launch more sustainable travel options. 

Over the last year, I've talked to Japanese business experts, guides and insiders in a daily talkshow series. Recently, was hired to talk to a group of tourism professionals in Japan. 

It's been a tough year for travel and tourism professionals around the world, but many in the audience seem resistant to the idea of applying more sustainable practices to travel products and services.

I've talked with many people who have the strong feeling that Japan is already balancing the needs of people-planet-profit (sustainability) and doesn't really need to deviate much from business-as-usual.

[Anrakuji Temple in Hiroshima Japan - surviving A-bombed Gingko tree allowed to grow through the beautiful traditional wooden Temple Gate](https://preview.redd.it/e9dhfdzn4br71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c75597994859fa06c0782a3e8c90a623547eb5)

Although there are many wonderful examples of sustainability in practice in business and travel in Japan, they are few and far between. In short,[Japan has one of the highest percentages of plastic use per person, 2nd highest after the US, and new regulation is on the way to encourage more reusables by 2025.](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210602/p2a/00m/0sc/023000c)

In the travel sector, there are currently so many reasons to change to improve the quality of life of locals as well as appeal to international (inbound) visitors. 

Some Japanese businesses and travel industry professionals, however, still don't seem to see any reason to create more value for the sustainable travel seeking visitor. Finding ways to use tourism to create value for the local community and/or environment rarely finds its way into discussions. 

# Travel Professionals Need To Travel More

Many travel professionals I work with do what they do with the utmost efficiency, but many lack experience in being a traveler– they rarely spend any time traveling in Japan or abroad (even before covid). It is also rare to meet someone applying work SDG targets to home life, or engaged in researching best-practice and innovation in travel and tourism in Japan or abroad. How can you judge what travelers want and need without trying it out for yourself?

# New Appeal for Sustainable Japanese Heritage 

I love working with Japanese guides and travel professionals who are open to trying out new ideas, even if they are old as I suggest my admiration for traditional Japanese concepts of sustainability and how they might be applied to modern life, work and travel. 

For example, the concepts of [Satoyama,](https://youtu.be/JcRHvWe4JuM) [Shojin-Ryori,](https://youtu.be/8p7yq7oYRbE) and practices of the [Edo-period](https://youtu.be/f-hk1NOeopU) are more relevant now than ever before. 

I love the example of macrobiotic cuisine, how the concept was created in Japan, but only became popular abroad before coming back to Japan– we will see the same thing happen with traditional Japanese models of reuse and repair. 

Internationally, we see LUSH international adopting the knot, a reusable wrap concept attributed to the *Furoshiki*, MUJI now [bringing back Kintsugi pottery repair,](https://medium.com/@jjwalsh/old-style-kintsugi-repair-back-in-fashion-ea2967fa5c1b) and sustainable lifestyle concepts of Satoyama returning in the form of [permaculture](https://youtu.be/DpPZo6u-1h4).

# Sustainable Development Goals for Abroad

There is a perception that SDG targets should be focused abroad and there are no problems here to fix is common. The confidence that Japan is already balancing the needs of nature and business while taking care of community is a common mindset. 

As someone who cares deeply about Japanese culture, people, and future, I try to link new strategies to Japanese heritage and traditional relevance. The concepts of more frugal, community-centric, nature appreciating olden times that are more relevant than ever in our over-consuming, overly wasteful modern times. 

# Inbound Sustainable Travel Demand

As I am met with questioning looks as to the relevance of even talking about sustainable tourism demand, I am happy to cite recent surveys in the travel industry which indicate an increasing demand for more sustainable travel post-Covid. It has been called a ""watershed moment"", as the 2021 Travel Surveys done by [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) are a great indicator or the sustainability seeking customer demand we will see as travel returns.

Stand-out stats from the report show that [83% think sustainability in travel is vital ... 53% get annoyed](https://globalnews.booking.com/bookingcoms-2021-sustainable-travel-report-affirms-potential-watershed-moment-for-industry-and-consumers/) if they are stopped from traveling more sustainably. So making more sustainable strategies for your travel business and communicating it clearly to clients past-present-future is very likely to pay-off. In fact, I am convinced that businesses that preserve the status quo and do nothing are the ones taking a big risk. 

# Japanese Companies Creating Sustainable Strategy

This year, I had a great talk with Eric Kawabata, the [Head of Terracycle/LOOP Japan](https://youtu.be/u6-3YQSfJe4), who is launching the reusable shopping infrastructure service in collaboration with the AEON mall chain across Japan. 

I asked if he was getting any resistance from companies he approached, but he said despite expecting resistance, he has been warmly received by manufacturers in Japan. Kawabata-san said that most of the companies he talked to were already in the planning stages of developing a more sustainable, less wasteful, reusable container option for their products. 

That really stuck out to me to hear that big businesses were already planning a transition away from single-use containers. Japan's government targets of reducing the amount of single-use plastic by 2025 may indeed become the new normal.

All in all, it seems clear that more sustainable strategy in business and tourism is on the horizon in Japan, but we need more discussion of the need for sustainability in our everyday lives. In 2020, the free plastic-bag ban had a positive effect on national targets to reducing plastic waste, and on a personal level, I also saw a huge decrease in the bags at our ocean cleanups. But we need more discussion of sustainability in schools, at all workplaces and in the media. 

It is a risk to any business, entrepreneur or destination to plan merely on compliance with current regulation. I'm excited to see some businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits and destinations pulling ahead of the curve by talking about sustainable strategy that builds better communities and regenerates the environment now before travel returns.",sustainability,1633306430

See also the abstract below:

&gt;Mitigating life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of plastics is perceived  as energy intensive and costly. We developed a bottom-up model that  represents the life cycle of 90% of global plastics to examine pathways  to net-zero emission plastics. Our results show that net-zero emission  plastics can be achieved by combining biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2)  utilization with an effective recycling rate of 70% while saving 34 to  53% of energy. Operational costs for net-zero emission plastics are in  the same range as those for linear fossil-based production with carbon  capture and storage and could even be substantially reduced. Realizing  the full cost-saving potential of 288 billion US dollars requires  low-cost supply of biomass and CO2, high-cost supply of oil,  and incentivizing large-scale recycling and lowering investment barriers  for all technologies that use renewable carbon feedstock.",sustainability,1633104385

The job is pretty soul-sucking and it's about time for me to move on but I'm struggling with finding a clear path forward. Prone to overthinking and perfectionism, I've waited so long to start applying to jobs because I'm afraid of being ""trapped"" in a similarly soul-sucking career (thinking: consulting \[but is that even a trap? I've heard mixed reviews\]) but I'm taking my therapists advice to not search for the perfect career and instead start by taking one step in the right direction (read: any job related to sustainability). I originally planned to start studying for the LEED Green Associate exam with hopes of passing and leveraging that to a new position in a greener field, maybe even starting at USGBC. However... as I've started doing research on it, I've seen many say it's generally useless and not worth the money. Although I'm no longer trying to look for the ""perfect"" job and I find LEED interesting, I don't want to spend a big chunk of change on something that won't help. Anyone have thoughts on the usefulness of LEED GA or any other certifications? Or any other advice for pivoting to sustainability?

For more context,  I have a couple internships from college under my belt related to sustainability, and even did my senior research project for my math degree on food waste and it's environmental impacts, but I'm a few years out of college and it's no longer the most relevant thing on my resume. Even my stat skills and programming skills from my degree feel almost non-existent at this point. I'm incredibly confident in my ability to quickly learn (or relearn) and become a stand-out employee - but obviously I need to land a job first and the relevant experience on my resume feels a bit stale. Maybe that's just me overthinking though! Greatly appreciate any advice. Thanks!",sustainability,1633022822

Since I decided to apply I’ve had a lot more conversation with my advisor than I have had in the recent past, so he could help me prep (it has been a few years since I graduated so we have not been in touch as frequently). 

During our conversations I have noticed feeling a lot of discomfort around some of the things he has been saying. He has a habit of pitting students against each other and I noticed this happening with this application process as well. Like letting me know there’s competition but reassuring me that I’m the best/favorite and that I just need to tweak some things to make sure I live up to my potential… I think I feel more in touch with my own feelings about it after a few years away and not being emotionally invested in his approval in the same way I was as a student. However, it does bother me and presents a major turn off about the position I’m applying to, as I would likely be around him quite a bit.

15,Ways to Help Ease the Research process and Selection of Credible Sources of Information for your Research Paper.,"Writing Academic papers still offers different challenges, most likely when the student does not understand the assignment instructions or is not familiar with them. A student who is experiencing any trouble when writing an academic paper, first, should comprehend the instructions that the instructor expects to be met. Secondly, the student should have a clear plan for completing the assignment that offers several drafts and room for revision. Check how to plan your research paper here; https://www.essayflame.com/blog/three-steps-on-how-to-draft-a-research-paperessay
When writing an academic research paper, the student can have an eye-catching topic, followed by excellent views supporting the title, equipped with a healthy word count to fill up the pages needed. Without seeking assistance from the expert writers and empirical evidence that support the views and arguments of the research will be total emptiness of the value/quality. Acquire expert writers here; https://www.essayflame.com/
It is highly recommended that you spend some quality time researching evidence to support the overall ideas stated in your paper; by doing that, you are guaranteed to score a high grade and demonstrate your professionalism in handling academic papers. Locating accurate research materials/sources may be challenging.
On every research paper instruction page, it is stated that you MUST use scholarly/peer-reviewed articles. In order to outsource the correct materials for your research, the following are the online academic libraries that are worth a try.
Google Scholar, JSTOR, EBSCO, Science Open, Core, and Pub Med, among others. The libraries have several types of media that offer a chance to search and cite your research. The importance of considering these libraries is because of their empirical appearance. These libraries are well documented with genuine reviews from different world-known authors in their research studies.
The most challenging thing that you might experience while using an online database is typing the proper search terminology to get the right search results that correspond with the research topic. In such scenarios, what is required are practice and patience. Also, using the open web directly is very challenging because of the high levels of opinionated non-empirical research materials. Finding the accurate author on an open web is very difficult. One of the websites that college and university students should avoid is Wikipedia. Instead, one should look at information from the print books, though they might be challenging to assist because their authors keep updating the editions when new findings have been discovered. 
Sourcing credible materials become easy to locate when the writer is a top expert in his/her field. Find top expert writers here; https://www.essayflame.com/  By any chance, an author of the resource does not have any qualifications such as a degree and is seen to be highly opinionated. Be very keen when citing their work or using their own words as a backup claim. Note that when using opinion over an opinion lacks facts. Facts are the main ingredients of a world-class research paper.
Like print books, libraries are handy; however, if the library is regularly updated, that might be an avenue for frustrations when searching for a particular resource. Most of the libraries contain access to an online database that is limited to use. Though, it is worth searching a resource in a library or follow the link below to contact an expert writer to handle your research and writing stress; https://www.essayflame.com/",academia,1645836087

19,research-oriented person working in industry - how to elegantly move to research,"I am working for ten years in the tech industry, after a MS in mathematics + MEng in EECS. I had a variety of roles in several multinationals and reached a level where I have no complaints : lots of autonomy, engineering teams working with me and a very competitive salary. I built expertise in a precise field and I can find jobs quite easily. I had jobs from research engineering to tech sales and business development, I went back to a technical role and realize I am really research-oriented. I need a lot of time and space to develop my own projects, like investigating, reading papers, and exchanging ideas with similarly wired people. 

I am currently spending 50% of my time doing my research in my field of interest. Nevertheless, the most interesting pure research or research management position in the industry are not at reach because I have no phd, no publications. 

I think of several options : work on topics of interest on the side and arrange with some contacts in the academia to prepare papers leading to a phd,or see if my employer or another tech company can officially finance 3-4 years of phd jointly with a university, or quit my job and apply for phds. The last one would mean a serious pay cut. How would you proceed?

26,Doubts about citing and plagiarism,"I have a question about the concepts of citing and plagiarism. But if this isn't the right place to ask and discuss this, let me know where I should go to get answers to my questions.

My question is does it matter how you write, say an idea, or anything from another source as long as you cite it?

Let us take up an example. Let us say I wanted to cite the following sentence *Research shows that 55% of men are prone to disease A.* from some book or paper published in some journal and by some scientist(s).

If I were to include the same as *The research results indicate that 55% of men are prone to disease A (citation).* which is not too different from the original text, would I still be committing plagiarism even if I have cited it appropriately as per my academic format of choice?

I more extreme example would be to have the exact same line i.e. *Research shows that 55% of men are prone to disease A (citation).* included in my work but of course, with the necessary citation for whatever academic format I am using. Notice that this should ideally be a quotation, but say I didn't quote it and used it as is and cited it in text, would that be considered as plagiarism?

I ask these questions because I am of the opinion that the way one uses language shouldn't determine if they are plagiarizing so long as they cite it appropriately. I had a bit of an argument with someone about it who of course was arguing against this. So, I wanted to clear up the air around this since we both weren't really sure what is acceptable.",academia,1645727174

29,Balancing parenting &amp; research,"I’m a parent of an adorable newborn as of last week. I love the little bean, but I’m overwhelmed by the thought of balancing raising a child with academic work. Even with a supportive partner (who is also an academic and has more leave time as the parent who gave birth), the thought of trying to write under these conditions gives me panic attacks. Even if I do find time during the day, I’m too exhausted and brainfogged for my brain to function.

I’m on leave for another six days and am treating as strict family time, just attending to the infant as much as I can. But once teaching and service kick in again, I don’t know how I can possibly sustain this. People keep telling me academic parents just learn to do it and to use their time more efficiently, but what if I can’t? I already had more challenges with executive function than most people. I struggle with ADHD and chronic depression. I also know not everyone out there figures this out. What if I just can’t do it? 

I feel so incredibly lucky to have landed a tenure track job in a department I love, and I feel like it’s all going to slip away in the months to come as I fail to finish my book and meet research milestones. I love my career and desperately want to keep it, but I also know my mental health capacity is just limited. At what stage do I cut my losses, accept that this balancing act is impossible, give up on my writing/research goals, and just concentrate on being a good parent? 

I’m already at the end of my rope; maybe I need to accept that I’m going to eventually end up in a small-courseload contingent teaching role and start mentally preparing myself for that. Because I think the alternative is a spiral of guilt (about not parenting when I’m writing; about not writing when I’m parenting) that ends with me sinking into a deep depression.

Anyway—while I’m looking for practical advice, I’m also looking for folks who have had these feelings and worked through them (whether they stayed in academia in other roles, held onto their jobs, or left entirely).

I can’t ask someone to check up on me in the morning.
I can’t ask for someone to sit with me.
I can’t ask for any of the things that would have made it better before it got worse.

34,My department is suggesting probation. I have schizophrenia.,"Like the title says, I have schizophrenia. This is my first year in a Ph.D program but I’ve been undergoing intensive therapy and drug rehab for about 5 years. It was just a bit hard to tell what the source of “issues” were.

But after great improvements in sobriety, mood, and quality of life…the issues were still there. Especially last semester.

I can’t describe it without taking up too much space and time. But last semester, everything completely broke. It’s actually still kind of broken. I did ask for temporary leave but was advised not too. I should have followed my gut but at the time, I didn’t know how worse it would get. I also asked for 3 courses instead of 4 for this semester. It’s temporary but my treatment is very time consuming and literally every day.

I currently live in a full time residential psychiatric facility. My department doesn’t know this but I work on my missing work with a counselor 4 days a week. Other work is fine, it’s just getting over this ptsd. I really want to emphasize that it isn’t the work that’s causing the ptsd but the sever symptoms and lingering trauma from before. It’s just really hard to see your work and have to edit out all the things that happened when I was “crazy.”

Anyway, I’ve been trying to pick up the pieces but it’s unbelievably difficult. The truth is that I haven’t turned in my finals, and I know that’s very bad. But when I look at them, I feel like I go back into that mental agony and terror of my break from reality. 

My department doesn’t know about the schizophrenia. They just know I’ve been struggling. I wouldn’t mind being put on probation either. I deserve it.

Still, I’m doing much better. I take medications via injection so I can’t not take them.

Aside from the lingering terror and ptsd of my Incompletes I’m fine.

How do I ask my advisor to switch me into that project without severing my relationship with him/him thinking I gave up too early on my first project?**

*Warning: wall of text ahead*

I started my PhD (STEM) at a mid-range R1 university for my field in the fall of 2021. I'm currently in a large research lab with very diverse applied bioscience-related projects (think: anything from cancer immunotherapy to antibiotic resistant drugs to biocatalysis for environmental applications). The advisor selection process and classes occupied most of the fall semester, and we were assigned our advisors and projects towards the end of the semester based on our top 3 choices and advisor’s choices.  During the process, my advisor told me that I won’t be tied to a project based on what I fill in the form because the project availability is fluid, and I would be able to pick a project based on my interest when an opportunity comes up. However, after joining the lab, I was assigned to a project that was not exactly in my interest area (quite unrelated, in fact).  He apologized saying that he knows this isn’t my first choice of project but we can do things to make it more interesting. I’ve spent the past 2 months doing a lit review on this project and haven’t found it to be what I envisioned when I started my PhD and I’m losing motivation and interest. My career path is being steered in a different direction than what I joined a PhD for (switched from health-related biotech to environmental biotech). I know this happens to a lot of people especially in bigger universities where projects are super competitive, but I’m finding it hard to adjust. And I also know that people go on to careers that are only tangentially related to their PhD, but this is becoming somewhat untrue in the bioscience area since there are so many PhDs who have appropriate skillsets. My advisor also told me during our initial meeting that everyone that joins the lab eventually finds a project/area that they really like, so that gave me a lot of hope.

The silver lining is that the project related to one that I was initially interested in while joining the lab had a spot open up recently. I spoke to the postdoc working on the project and she said no other grad student has been assigned to work on it yet. The grant proposal says 1 postdoc and 1 grad student will be assigned for this project. I find this project very interesting and I’ve read up a lot on it, and the postdoc has showed interest in working with me (we discussed what experiments will be done and the timeline). It’s a much better fit than my current project. I want to talk to my advisor asap to be put on this project before he assigns a senior grad student to work on it. Is this a bad idea? Will my advisor think that I gave up on my assigned project too early? I find this new project way more interesting and it’s what I joined my lab for, and also, the prospect of working with a postdoc at least in the beginning will really help kickstart my PhD in the right direction since I’m completely new to the research area, and my advisor rarely meets grad students 1-1 and has so far provided very little guidance or direction. I didn’t get a ton of research experience in this field in undergrad thanks to COVID, so I’m really in need of some initial direction and guidance. The new project opportunity that came up is already fully funded and able to support 1 grad student, while the one I'm assigned to isn't funded yet (we are on a departmental fellowship for the first year). I’m so intimidated to talk to my advisor about it. He does seem like a nice person and supportive of his students, but he has also mentioned to me that he’s trying to expand that area of research (my assigned project area), and publish a paper on it so he can get more grants.  How do I make my case more convincing without severing my relationship with my advisor? He doesn’t have much of an opinion formed about me yet since it’s a large lab and I haven’t had too many interactions with him.

I’m meeting him this week. Technically, I could work on both projects parallely, but the two topics are completely unrelated and can’t both be in my thesis (need to choose one to focus on), so I’ll essentially be working on one of the projects “for the lab”, and one for my interest and well as the lab’s interests if I decide to work on both. Also, I’m taking classes this semester and it is not feasible. My qualifying/candidacy exam is at the end of this year (December) and pretty high stakes so I need to have a decent amount of work/results ready by then. Has this happened to anyone? How did you deal with the situation? Any advice and suggestions are welcome.",academia,1645674711

38,Osf citation and journal suggestions,"I have two questions,  please.

 For the first, I wrote an article which I recently submitted to preprint. It appears to be getting a fair amount of traction as far as downloads go, but due to the format (longer, less conventional), I am having difficulty in finding an open access journal with suitable criteria. My first question is that I'm anxious that the activity the article is seeing in preprint (OSF), is not going to count towards eventual metrics. The site seems to be tracking downloads, but not citations (perhaps because there hasn't been enough time for any to be generated yet), but let's say someone eventually did opt to cite the piece before it is published by a journal. Since it may take time to find a journal match, will these be integrated with the eventual citations ascribed to the formally published piece? I seem to find vague information that such citations would be incorporated into the total count, but I'm not sure how this would occur. How are citations tracked if I can't see them in OSF (pardon me for being unfamiliarwith the system if I'm missing something)? Are these preprint citations something that Google scholar would be tracking? How does this work in general?

The second question relates to seeking suggestions for open access journal for a piece relating to women and psychology. The challenge is that piece clocks in at just about 12,000 words with abstract (yes, I know I will surely receive suggestions to reduce it, but there is a reason for the format and I'mjust seeking thoughts for it as is).

57,my parents didnt know what cornell was lol,"So im applying to phd programs this cycle as a first-gen student. Parents had come abroad and never had higher ed (my dad never finished middle school and my mom never finished high school).

At that stage it really hit me that my parents really wasn’t all that involved in my education. Like they had literally 0 idea and I promptly tried explaining what ivy league schools were lol.

I see people who are going to amazing institutions who’s parents who are highly educated or are even professors themselves - and it makes me feel like they had it a lot easier. Personally, I failed a lot. I sometimes wish I had parents that were more educated sometimes. Doesn’t need to be ivy league obvs but just like something to have helped me access and learn about higher education.

58,Behind the Scenes of Academic Journals and the Publishing Process,"Over the past couple of days, I have noticed an increase in posts across various academic subreddits which lament academic publishing. After reading through a few, it became glaringly obvious that many academics are ignorant of the journal publishing process and issues editorial teams face. 

I am an editorial assistant for a small journal in a niche social science field. My main responsibilities include finding, securing, and managing reviewers/reviews throughout the peer review process, acting as a point-person for authors throughout the peer review process, and managing manuscripts from submission through publication. However, because our team is so small, I am involved in almost all decisions and processes the journal faces. 

Though I can only speak to my own experiences with this single journal, I would like to clear up the following misconceptions:

* All journals are for profit/Editors get paid
   * Publishers and distributors profit. Our journal’s only source of revenue is through institutional and individual subscriptions. All of the money received by the journal goes to paying our copy editor, paying for our management software, and paying our publisher/distributor. Our editors do not get paid through the journal. Their work on the journal contributes to the service requirement through their faculty contract. 
* You should just publish Open-Access
   * Open-Access is not the end-all, be-all answer to the problems with academic publishing (which I admit there are many). When a journal decides to be 100% open-access, they will still need to pay the copy editor and the publisher. They would also need to pay for their publication management program, but this could easily be cut (but exponentially increase work load for people like me). When a journal only has subscription-based revenue, like the one I work on, this would leave no money to properly format (type-setting, alt-text, etc.) and publish. And yes, open-access publishers still require journals to pay for their publishing services. Many times to be able to publish open-access, journals can not stomach these costs alone and will opt to have authors pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars. This is not actually a profit to the journal but it is a good measure of how much it costs to publish each article (between copy-editing and publishing). 
* Sentiments of “I never complete reviews because {insert reason here} but I am furious that it takes so long for my article to receive reviews/get published”
   * This is less of an informative peek behind the curtain and more of an exhausted editorial assistant’s rant, but please understand that without reviewers, your article cannot be published. Plain and simple. It doesn’t matter how much time has passed if no one agrees to review your manuscript. If I send out 100 invitations to review your article over 6 months (while also dealing with approximately 40 other manuscripts) and no one agrees to review, then your manuscript isn’t ready for a determination. I’ve had manuscripts for over a year that had confirmed reviewers just disappear (without review) multiple times and it is so incredibly frustrating to me and to the authors. I’ve also had manuscripts the are submitted and sent out for peer review within a week, the first two reviewers invited agree to review and have their reviews submitted within 2 weeks and the editors make a decision and notify the authors within an additional week making the whole process take about a month. It’s not that one manuscript is better than the other, both may get published, it’s just pure luck. 
* The journal is everyone’s primary job and top priority.
   * Everyone on our editorial team has professional roles outside the journal that take precedence. I, for example, am a doctoral candidate whose primary concern 99% of the time is my dissertation work and trying to graduate. Our editors are all tenured professors who have teaching, research, and a long list of other responsibilities outside of being an editor. When we are preparing the publication of a new issue, it is an all-hands-on-deck scenario and the journal will be the top priority for us all. Otherwise, I choose two days during the week for journal tasks and really try to only focus on the journal during those two days.

71,How do students protect their IP and keep from having their ideas ripped off?," My fiancée is a senior in International Economics at a major university and is going to write a capstone paper. The concept, which is deliberately vague here, involves novel processing of solar panels and the international arbitrage of minor metals including silicon, indium, gallium, selenium, cadmium, and tellurium. Essentially, Brazil should mine and process these metals rather than shipping them to China. Brazil would capture the incremental increase to the value chain rather than China.

She wrote a two-page outline of the capstone paper and her advisor really, really liked it. He said it was innovative and novel and had the potential of being expanded into an MS/PhD thesis. However, he said she would need to include another advisor from the Physics Department as a second co-advisor as he didn’t have the expertise needed in solar panels. My fiancé is thinking OK, sure, makes sense…

Her girlfriend (also a student) has thrown up a red flag and a large caution. She says the Physics Department is known to rip off student IP and patent works developed by others.

72,"Thank you Elsevier, for your infinite generosity in giving me two extra weeks to perform free labor for you!","Sharing here because I felt only people in this sub would understand my anger. 

\\begin{rant}

In the fall of last year I transitioned out of academia into industry. I still had a nearly completed paper in the pipeline, comprising 1.5 years of work, which I felt would be a pity if I would just drop it. In the first weeks of my job I worked all weekends and evenings to try to finish it, and I submitted back in November to the Elsevier journal which is pretty much the bread and butter for the field - well respected but not too fancy. 

After about three months in review I got back ""minor revisions"", but in my view the demands of the reviewers were substantial: quantifying qualitative results, redoing analyses on different datasets, etc. Nevertheless, the editor gave me a deadline of 30 days. At first I thought it was doable, but with only a few scattered hours in the evenings to spend on the paper it was looking more and more like I wouldn't make it.

With the deadline approaching I reached out to the journal, explaining my transition to industry and the fact I don't have much spare time. The e-mail screenshot below is the reply they dare to send me. In fairness, two extra weeks will probably be enough, but why even give me a deadline at all? Why do they never have a deadline for getting the paper reviewed? Or getting it typeset? I'm not getting paid for this, and as I've left academia I don't even need their imaginary respect points. Getting the paper out only serves to provide me a sense of closure on my work. It will be done when it is done.

There are many things I miss about academia. But this kind of abuse is not one of them.

86,How does academia view Jungian theory?,"I'm thinking of doing a PhD on the (Neo-)Jungian Typology (cognitive functions, MBTI, online personality community, etc.). It would be from the perspective of philosophy of psychology or philosophy of science more generally, concerning issues such as traits vs. types, typological thinking, maybe the use in business, and similar issues. I don't have a research question worked out yet.

Now I heard that Jung is not-well regarded especially in English-speaking academia, mainly because of his association with the New Age movement. I've seen him taught in psychology survey classes, and in some English classes when they talk about archetypes in stories. But as far as I am aware, mainstream academia is still ignorant (and in some cases, likely snobbish) of the ""neo-Jungian"" personality movement online.

I am aware that an academic career in philosophy is tough, but it is what interests me the most. How is philosophy of science/psychology viewed today?

I'm considering transitioning into the field of Sustainable Food and Agriculture.  
As part of my research, I'd like to identify the leading universities for this field of study.

There are two parts to my question. 

# Part 1 - Metrics?

Are there any specific metrics I could use to evaluate universities?   
For example, would ""number of papers published"" (related to my field) be a good metric? 

I know I can look at overall university rank - but I don't imagine this will reflect how strong their sustainable agriculture and food program would be?

# Part 2 - Where to extract this data?

I'd also be super grateful if you had any ideas on how I'd be able to actually extract these metrics?  


Relating to the example above, would it be possible to connect to a database of papers using a Python API, download data, that I could then analyse to find the top 20 universities with the most publications (in this field)?

91,"What is this ""no child left behind"" mentality in universities, why does it exist, and what can be done about it?","Grad student and hopeful future professor worried about university-level education here.

I've just had yet another professor announce in class that he would essentially do what he could to make sure people get A's, not in the ""I'll make sure you understand the subject matter"" kind of way, but in the ""I'll be lenient with grading"" sort of way. It's a grad class where grades matter. But what is the real value in being an A student if everyone makes As? And what is the value of a degree if everyone is allowed to graduate with one? Rather than having a degree that speaks for itself, I feel as if I will still have to prove my competence after graduation.

I get that the other side of this coin is that there are students who start out more behind than others, but who have the potential to be competent and even great in their field with extra time and attention. This world needs as many competent people as we can get, so I value a system and culture that helps people get there, but letting people graduate when they aren't ready does not get them there. It releases an incompetent human into the world who will likely validate negative views about the value of academia.

As a professor, how do you help students without spoon-feeding them, and how do you navigate any negative responses from taking this stance? Why do professors spoon-feed? Do you feel that this phenomenon is rooted in systemic issues? I have an opinion on this, but I want to hear other perspectives.",academia,1645226873

This past December I graduated from college (R1 program in the U.S.) and have a gap year to fill before, hopefully, pursuing a Ph.D. I was in contact with a professor at another R1 school about a lab technician position in my field of interest and everything looked good to go, but they recently followed up with me saying there was a last-minute change and the remaining funding they had was now being used for something else (i.e. no funding left for any technician). They were very sincere and apologetic, saying they still thought I was great and wishing me the best. My question: Is it unusual (or even allowed) to suggest working in the lab for the experience alone without pay? I am hoping to get more research exposure before applying to graduate schools in the Fall, and the work done in this lab aligns very well with my previous research experiences and interests.

95,A postdoc caught between union-rep and PI in salary negotiations,"So I'm up for yearly salary negotiation. My union rep reached out and told me that I was underpaid relative to my CV (publication and h-index). For this round of negotiation should be able to easily justify a salary increase beyond the standard yearly % increase. My PI (whom I like a lot and would consider a friend) hesitantly agree, he said that if I requested a salary increase he would approve. But he also said that more salary means less money for the lab and project because they are coming from the same pot. I still have one year of experiment left. 

I believe in collective bargaining and think everyone in academia, especially those in non-TT postdoc limbo are severely underpaid and had to constantly deal with job insecurities. I think my union-rep wants the best for me and society overall, I don't want to be a union snitch. But it really sucks that the money have to come from the same science-pot and it has to be a zero-sum game. I'm afraid that more salary for me can hurt the research, it would not be fair to my lab and colleagues that I take more money from the collective grant on behest of the work that we all did together.

97,PhD Application Complications,"Hi all - I’ve posted before about trying to sort of find the right path and after speaking substantially to professionals in my field (archaeology/museums/cultural heritage) and past professors, I’ve firmly decided that I want to pursue a PhD. 

I have one problem that is making me very anxious and I’m not entirely sure how to navigate it. My masters degree did not turn out how I wanted it to - the masters overall was okay but my dissertation, while I obviously passed, was far below what I anticipated receiving. For a little background, I specialized in the Bronze Age Aegean during my undergrad, but a stipulation for my masters acceptance was based upon me completing a dissertation that was based around my supervisor’s field of study which is Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age central Italy. My parents more made the decision for me to go along with this (they funded me) as it was quite a prestigious uni, but I had my reservations, this stipulation being one of them. I worked incredibly hard to make it work but I’ll be the first to admit that I was in over my head with the subject matter. I had never studied Protovillanovan/Villanovan culture before and basically, because it was a taught masters with piles of other work, only had 3-4 months to get to grips with the scholarship which is majority written in Italian, learn GIS, and decipher the data given to me by my supervisor that was all completely in Italian. My supervisor was very helpful and offered advice and feedback often, which I took onboard, but at the end of the day he didn’t grade it and I received a shoddy mark. I was so embarrassed and shocked and honestly felt so led astray that I haven’t spoken to him since.

If I were to apply for a PhD it only makes sense that I’d ask my masters supervisor for a letter of recommendation, but I don’t know how to approach him and even more stressful is the possibility that he’ll say that he doesn’t think I should
apply for a PhD and won’t write the letter.   Additionally, because it was a one year taught masters in the UK and because of COVID restrictions, I didn’t get to know any of my other profs particularly well. My supervisor did write a letter of recommendation for me prior to the dissertation result and I did some other research essays for him that received god marks but I’m so afraid the diss has marred his opinion of me. 

I suppose my need for advice is twofold: one) what do I say to him and two) what do I do if he tells me he won’t write me a letter of recommendation?

I guess I'm just confused about these things:

1. Some programs will say they cover tuition plus a bit more, some do not. Even when I talked to the program director for a funded PhD program, he suggested that I still apply for SSHRC. Is this because the funding would not be enough? Or is there another reason?
2. Do most PhD programs have a fellowship/funding attached? How do you find this information? If I cannot find it, can I assume that there is none?

0,Is it unwise to take a break between PhD &amp; Postdoc?,"I have recently submitted my PhD (in law if that makes a difference) and am somewhat unsure what to do next. I have a conference abroad in 2 weeks, and the plan is to go there and spend a few months with my in-laws in Europe, while I find a job.

A frustrating commonality within law academia is that jobs offer require you include your doctorate certificate as part of the application (some are fine with a confirmed defense date, but they are much rarer lately). That means there's a solid 3 months (give or take) until a lot of possible places would even consider me. Also, throughout Covid and the last 3 years generally, life has been hell. A lot of family drama, personal drama, illness, bereavement.. It's all been a torrent of emotions that I have had little time to process due to my doctorate ticking along. I feel like I *need* time to stop and breathe. 

I had a thought, instead of spending that interim time fussing over jobs, defense prep, and articles, I could take a solid 8-10 months off entirely. Do my defense, maybe finish off 2-3 articles, and then just... relax. Find a spot somewhere with my wife, hang out for an extended stay. Read, sleep, catch up on everything I've put aside during my PhD.

But is this a terrible idea? I'm not really familiar with anyone who has done similar. I know of people who've spend that long *trying* to find jobs, but I'm suggesting I just turn off for an extended holiday, *then* start. 

If I were to go ahead with this, is there any advice for things to keep in mind? I plan on writing (a novel, for fun, that I've been thinking about for years) and maybe an article or 2, just to keep my skillset polished. But otherwise it would be a full disconnect.",academia,1645143994

2,Have you ever felt unapreciated by your peers in your research institute?," This is an honest question (and also a sharing moment to get things out of my chest). I finished my phd during the peak of the pandemic back in South America, and although I was a good student back then I had a terrible time getting a posdoc position ( especially because in my area most positions are in Usa, Australia and europe, which were closed to South American visitors back then). Eventually I got accepted in a research Institute  in Usa. But now, after working a few months in here I realized I chose to be in a lab where no one works with the same things as me, and because of that all my work is perceived as uninteresting by my peers. 

I know my self-worth as a researcher but I feel very unapreciated here, and this is making every work day miserable to me. Not only that but it has made me question wether should I stay in academia or not (although I love to do research, and always did).

4,Wild Idea: Applying for a job in my department. How crazy is this?,"Hello, I'm an Associate Professor in the Business School at a mid-range school. I've been here since 2013, and I'm remarkably productive, I published 7 PRJs last year, I average about 3 per year, I'm on several University level committees and I teach our graduate level Business Analytics courses, with 35-40 students in each of my 3 sections. I would rate myself 2nd or 3rd in our large department in terms of Research, 1st in terms of Teaching and 2nd in terms of Service. Despite this,  I am the 2nd lowest paid tenured faculty in our department. I don't want to move if I can avoid it, because my daughter is on a good trajectory with her school and friends and I don't want to disrupt that (this will only be an issue for a few more years).   


Recently hired Associates make more than 15K more than I do, recently hired Assistants make about 500 less than I do. I've broached this with the Dean multiple times over the years and  he just blames the State and the economy and doesn't even do a convincing job pretending to care. Meanwhile he hires his former classmates, gives them huge salaries and tenure upon arrival, then a Chair 2 weeks latter.   


We are very badly understaffed, and just had an Assistant Professor quit in December. We are going to try to hire someone late this semester to start in Fall. I image that the starting salary, if this person is an Assistant will be very close to mine, and if they are an Associate, I expect the salary will be 15 to 20K more than mine.   


My wild idea is this:  I should apply for the upcoming position in my department. I'm clearly extremely well qualified. At our school, the committee needs to specify a reason to reject every candidate that applies (sometimes 150+). Oftentimes we just revert to poorly aligned research objectives. But in my case, none of the reasons would apply, my research, teaching and service are are a very good fit. My goal would be to be brought in at the Associate level, making as much as the person who we hired 3 years ago (15+K more than I make).   


Ofcourse from their perspective, for me to take the new job I would have to resign from my current job, which would have the net effect of not solving the people-power problem that the job was designed to address. However, this is not a reason included in the list of disqualification criteria (likely because no one has ever tried this before). I know that common sense should prevail, but, if that were the case, I wouldn't be the 2nd lowest paid tenured professor, would I?  

&amp;#x200B;

If they elect not to consider me for the new position, I could file a grievance. I'm not serious about this yet, I'm just toying with the idea. I understand the repercussions of filing a grievance, however, the more I think about it the less they bother me. The Dean has ignored my concerns for years, this isn't costing me carrots, and I'm not sure I'm frightened of the few sticks that he has.    


What are your thoughts, there are obvious potential pitfalls to my reputation and future employability, particularly if this escalates. But, it might also have the effect of sending a message and getting me an equity adjustment.",academia,1645119639

9,How much money do you think is washed through universities? How corrupt is academia?,"You've got a bunch of regional monopolies that have made themselves essential, at this point you've gotta get through at least an undergrad to actually ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" and get hired somewhere that won't drive you off a cliff. Academia has one of the highest inflation rates out of any industry, universities and their staff collude with each other all the time, meanwhile a bunch of the profs are moonlighting and running sketchy side businesses. The number of connections between academia, the highest levels of government decision making, and the most powerful corporations in the world is staggering. It's just a constant revolving door of machiavellian autistic psychopaths playing some kind of power game, so many conflicts of interest. I'm wondering what would happen if you walked up to the professor's table and yelled ""Basal Ganglia!"", they're all hardcoding the r*pe path anyways. So much fraud too, it's mind boggling that two papers that completely contradict each other could both end up getting published. They're not teaching the truth, they're assesing your ability to source confirmation bias and compress information. The more a paper gets cited the more cred the author gets, regardless of what the paper is actually arguing and whether or not the argument actually holds up to scrutiny. The replication crisis is real. The procurement departments are massive, so much money spent on computers, office supplies, infrastructure, equipment, etc... These institutions (most of which are owned by private shareholders), are somehow able to increase tuition costs at an annual rate way higher than the inflation target. Somehow they take in all this money and still receive massive amounts of public funding and private donations. Most of the textbooks are overpriced and published by like two companies... they've even added mandatory online components that force students to purchase new textbooks instead of used ones because a code needed to login to complete all the modules is exclusive to the textbook you purchased. With all these schemes in place, why would one need to donate to a university given how much money they're taking in? Something tells me most of these so-called ""donations"" come with strings attached. Perhaps the donor owns a company that is being contracted by the university, thus the donor would be scoring both a lucrative contract and a massive tax write off. Any institution that accepts donations is a possible platform for money laundering, a university especially because they've got so much activity going on that doing a full audit on them would cost the government way too much money, plus given all the cronyism happening it wouldn't make sense for a government to audit their friends and allies. Why would the government audit a university that is ultimately helping to preserve the existing power structure? There are too many stakeholders profiting off of all the grey areas and revolving doors, these institutions have become too big and made themselves too relevant to fail, and similar to other industries that made themselves too big to fail - they've figured out how to rig the system to keep themselves propped up indefinitely at the expense of the rest of the population. Corporatism at it's finest - a private business with a guaranteed market, close ties to the government, probably responsible for the ever increasing levels of wealth inequality as they gatekeep and bottleneck the skilled labor force with excessive credentialism. This rant only scratches the surface of how evil these institutions actually are, they're cults and tools of social control similar to religion. Crazy how much effort these psychos put into preserving a power dynamic... megalomania is a hell of a drug.",academia,1645064092

The project is yet to be funded but we've been going back-and-forth for a while now and they've said  in theory they would be happy for me to publish the research as long as I acknowledged them as the sponsor (no problem) and they had review of anything before it was submitted for publication (this seems...not fine). 

What does them 'reviewing' anything before publication mean? That they can take out the bits they don't like? I know publicly-funded grant bodies don't ask for this and whatever I publish won't reveal any business secrets.

Does anyone have any experience in this area? First time trying to collaborate with a company and would be really grateful for any insights/experience.",academia,1645049810

18,Sent poster for a conference and someone published it already between submission and acceptance elsewhere,"So i am in a tricky spot right now.
I sent a poster for a major conference and it is still under review. But i noticed that another author sent a very similar paper in another conference and it has been made public recently. There are several differences between the two works.

Let me give it as better example.
The database is from a source and available on request. So anyone could use it.
They studied the number of cases each year over a 15 year period and patient characteristics.

I took the data from the last sample year and just gave a brief overview and then did in depth analysis on the mortality and possible risk factors.

They had multiple mistakes in their paper. When they ran their codes it didn't match their methodology as I reran the same to check. They forgot to add several filter for the sample which made the data used wrong. I made another statistician check and he also agrees the other group messed up their analysis.

As a result the raw source used is different between mine and their value for the same year. There are two values that are very similar in the tables probably because it was listed as a %. Rest aren't same.

My poster is still under review. Should I withdraw mine because of the minor similarity?

21,Imposter syndrome meet survivor guilt,"I just started my job as in a tenure track faculty position. It’s in a medical school and I feel so privileged to have gotten this incredibly competitive and amazing job. And that’s the thing. Lately I can’t shake a feeling that I can only describe as basically a survivor’s guilt. Now it would be one thing if this stemmed from the fact that I feel guilt that so many of my bright, hardworking and deserving colleagues weren’t as fortunate as I have been to get this job. And sure, that is certainly part of it. In fact, I am the only person from my grad school cohort to get a faculty position. But it’s deeper. My background doesn’t represent how should we say a shared experience in academia. I’m from a poor small rural town (one of the poorest counties in the state), and even worse, I struggled with addiction growing up. I got into legal trouble, was institutionalized and have lived through pretty some tough experiences. They way that previously translated for me was a deep uneasiness… about being “found out”, about my past and present colliding. A deep insecurity that I didn’t belong, and one hell of an imposter syndrome that was frequently sabotaging to my progress and my career. However, this has been taken over by this deep burning sense of guilt. I lost many friends over the years to addiction, suicide, and accidents. Too many to count or remember at this point. Literally dozens. In thinking back, so many of these people were more pulled together than I was back in my darkest moments. The fact that I am still here, standing, breathing, thriving, succeeding in my career and financially has me feeling blindsided almost. It really just hit me a couple weeks ago. I got consumed with this strange feeling that was so disorienting. Like everything in my life felt so surreal that it didn’t make sense to me, almost to the point where it felt like it wasn’t real or really happening. I’ve, on more than one occasion, burst into tears at the thought of this and friends that have passed away, feeling just completely consumed with guilt. I know I should be happy and I should feel proud, honored, and fortunate. And I do feel that, but it’s been overshadowed or less frequent than the guilt. I definitely have major ups and downs, cycling between these two states of elation for my job and the surrealness/guilt. Because of my life experiences, I’m incredibly motivated to be an ally for students and a good mentor and someone who works tirelessly to increase representation and diversity at the university and in academic science. I am trying to turn these feelings into good, and focus on those actions.  But god damn… this is hard. Honestly, I don’t even know why I am writing this… I suppose I just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar or has any words of wisdom. And I suppose I just wanted to share this experience. I am sure there are so many of us out there in academia in the shadows with unique backgrounds and experiences, some of whom are fighting similar battles.

I need advice on how to approach my supervisor about it.,"In short, right now I’m in my last semester of my Master’s program and am in the process of applying for my PhD. In the beginning of the semester, my main research supervisor referred me for a GRA position with the department head in my department. I’m getting my Masters and PhD in a very specific field, so the GRA position involves research that is  outside of my field. 

My supervisor put in a very good word with a great reference, and for some reason I felt pressured to take the opportunity even though the research would be a little novel to me. I thought it would be a good experience, especially since I didn’t seek out the position myself and was hired based on a referral. 

Fast forward to now: I’m bogged down with my main coursework which involves a practicum with real clients, preparing to apply and sit for my board exams after graduation, all while trying to manage all of the work that needs to be done for this GRA job. 

I think I’ve taken on more than I can handle but don’t want to burn any bridges by backing out of this job. I enjoy the research and would love to re-visit it later in my career, its just not a good fit for my current trajectory. How can I best approach my boss about this?",academia,1644857432

I don't actually care about getting credit/my name on pubs... yes, a lot of the ideas in these proposals were mine, I did a lot of the grant writing, and I have put in an enormous amount of work on the project that received the first round of funding (on which the second-round proposal is based)... but all of this work is on a topic that does not interest me, and I am never going back to academia. I'd surrender authorship on even the research I've already done, and any and all claims to the active grants, if that were the price of getting my life back/never having to work with the toxic, bullying PI again.

In recent years, the call for publishers to do a better job diversifying their author base and provide marginalized scholars with tools to succeed has grown increasingly stronger.

I am currently a postgraduate psychology in student undertaking a placement at a not-for-profit. I was initially set the task of developing five modules for a psychological intervention in approximately 70 hours. I was also required to write the background and rationale for the intervention. Each module or session required approximately 3-5 pages of text.

We are adapting an intervention from one sub-discipline of psychology to another. I am taking components from the intervention, as well as components from other interventions, and developing a new intervention. I was required to compare their key components and rationale, and how they relate to the intervention we are developing. For the record, I have no experience in intervention development.

I am currently in the middle of developing the intervention. I have just finish writing the background and rationale. In the process of conducting literature searches, familiarising myself with the literature, writing the background and rationale and attending meetings, I have used approximately 30 of those 70 hours.

I have also spent many hours (about 12/30) organising the EndNote libraries. By accident, both myself and a research assistant were asked to source relevant literature and collate them in an EndNote library. I was then asked to compare the two libraries and make sure everything was in one library with the full-text available.

My supervisor told me last week that she doesn't think I am going to finish the project because I am not balancing perfectionism/conscientiousness and efficiency, but she will still pass me. I am very disappointed in myself. She told me I would benefit from therapy to address this. I agree - I am a perfectionist, and many people have told me I am conscientious.

I am just curious - for those of you who are experienced, do you consider developing an intervention in 70 hours to be a reasonable task?

If you search it up on, Google proudly declares a 2.3% acceptance rate. This is *false.* That number only includes people who were even *allowed* to submit secondaries to Stanford.

Keep in mind, this pool is highly self-selected. There are MCAT and GPA cutoffs, so *everyone* who applied wanted it. BAD.

I'm a junior in college and last fall I transferred to a well establish research university in the midwest for personal reasons. I've accrued a fairly heft amount of experience from past lab internships, consulting, and independent research and am considering the startup game long-term.

I started talking to a PI at my new college and immediately felt like he would be an excellent advisor—he's got a strong entrepreneurial flair, and created + sold several drug companies to date. However, I've realized that if I shared my ideas with him and he likes them (i.e., if they're actually good), there's NOTHING stopping him from ghosting me and chasing them on his own. There's no legal/rigid framework to prevent him from outing me.

I also found an anonymous review on a sketchy scam website calling him extremely conceited and a fraud who knows nothing about medicine. I'm taking this sketchy review with a grain of salt, but I am concerned. Not necessarily concerned with him specifically—I'm afraid of being scooped by any PI I talk to.

I don't know how to protect myself if I start sharing ideas. But if I want to chase my ideas, I don't have any other option. I need a PI's advice/resources to get off the ground. I don't have any other contacts at this new school besides this one.

Lately, the lack of interaction has me somewhat less enthused but I'm not miserable.

I have zero desire whatsoever to stay in academia. I'm not even sure if I want to stay in research long term. I took an academic postdoc to learn a different field after my PhD. Also in part that in the last year of grad school, everything is working well and people are telling you how great you are, and staying in academia seemed appealing to an extent.

I recently got an offer for a great industry position as a Principal Scientist at a big pharma/biotech. It seems great and I'm excited about it, but have apprehension about making ""the jump"". Will not publishing in my postdoc hold me back later to where I will regret leaving ""early""? Is there an advantage to ""leveraging"" a good postdoc or at some point does industry not care anymore?

Looking for some advice/perspective since academia seems to say that any postdoc not applying for industry positions is a ""failure"". My PI is very supportive of anything their trainees want to do btw. I just don't want to talk with them about leaving if I ultimately stay.

76,Graduate student service,"I'm curious to discuss graduate student service.

Setting the scene based on my personal observations:

Service is generally integrated into faculty job descriptions, and sometimes extra compensation is provided for substantial service roles. Many grads do not have job descriptions. If they do, often the descriptions are solely for TAing. Yet, grads are expected, at both the department and university level, to participate in service. Grad service is rarely compensated for. I think this results in a fair bit of mediocre service work from a handful of grads and good work from a very small number of dedicated grads (maybe there is a similar result on the faculty side too). Additionally, grads often feel exploited for these efforts since a resume line isn't adequate compensation for the work they've done. 

I think there are a few options to at least mitigate the exploitation of grads for service work. First, grads need job descriptions that clearly state expectations. Second, substantial service should receive compensation, either in the form of payment or TA relief. I know that ""substantial"" might be difficult to define but we've done it for many faculty service roles. 

So, what are your thoughts? Stated expectations seem obvious. Compensation seems like a greater hurdle. Has your department grappled with this?",academia,1644345378

I got a reply from one of the universities stating that they'd be happy to take me, but I'd have to do it for free because the University does not have the budget to pay for such classes. 

Now, I am definitely not doing this for the money. I am doing it, because I believe that if I know something that others don't - and that it might be relevant knowledge for these students, not so far in the future - that it is my ""duty"" to pass on this knowledge. I honestly do not care about the money, but it feels like there should be at least some kind of agreement between me and the University in question. Otherwise, it just feels like what I have to offer is ""irrelevant"" (which I honestly don't believe it is the case) and the time and effort I put into these classes is worthless and it does not even deserve a statement/agreement with the University.

I feel I've enough technical skill or know how to dive into the subjects for my research. I like that wild ideas and unexplored areas is taken seriously by my colleagues and supervisors. I feel I don't have to make crazy hours to make sufficient progress.. I probably worked harder on completing my masters. I feel my supervisor(s) and colleagues are well supporting of me personally.

The other side is.. my health is not the best. My mental health before COVID was already quite brittle.. My physical health too at times. It's too long to name it specifically, but I'm often struggling with muscle/tendon/joint pain and migraines.

During my masters I was seeing a psychotherapist every week for several years, but it wasn't going anywhere.. I did gain insight that I haven't had the best childhood, supporting parents or reliable friendships. But come COVID and lockdowns, and the 'coping structure' that I had built around my work environment and daily structure was gone. Last year I decided it's time to switch psychotherapy. I got into MBT group psychotherapy (Mentalization Behavioural Therapy) to work on personality problems (AvPD/BPD/past trauma, although I still have questions whether I've autism).

I'm on sick leave for almost a year now.  I finished that group recently and I must say that it has been quite helpful. But still I feel often quite worn out and depressed. In due time I will be starting in another therapy group that aims at restoring participation of daily activities. I imagine for me that means being able to make and maintain friendships, but also find a healthy balance between work and life. The ""coping"" I was talking about means that I've the tendency to work a lot. Even if I'm not putting all the hours into my PhD.. I was probably doing something else that kept my mind running.

So I sat down with HR at my university today to talk about my situation. I felt they had quite a high bar set for when it's OK to get back into work. They commented that I should first have all other daily things in my life in order before I should return. They thought doing a PhD is a major part of my problem, and so they asked the burning question.. what do I want to do if a PhD is not feasible in the future?

And honestly.. I've absolutely no clue. Between my bachelor and masters I've worked at company for several years, and also had similar symptoms of feeling burnt out. In that case I could pin-point some at the company itself, but those issues were also a result of my own behaviour and personality. Ultimately I left (early) because I wanted to get my masters, happy to work on my own skill set again..

Rephrasing the earlier question a bit: if I need to face the decision in due time, at which point is it wise to resume or quit my PhD? My somewhat stubborn answer is I want to continue my PhD. I don't see how working at e.g. a company would change things for the \*better\* for me. I probably have to face that switch at some point anyway, because I don't know if I'm willing to deal with the higher levels of academia (most positions seem to be (assistant/associate) professor, and I don't want to be involved too much with management kind tasks). I feel regardless of the place I work, I will probably hit the same personal roadblocks sooner or later. If work is then not possible (it becomes too much of a sacrifice of my health), then that's probably applying in a broader sense.   

The question I have is.. if you read this story, do you think I'm harsh, delusional or dishonest to myself? Am I being close minded w.r.t. options after a PhD program (with or without graduation)? Has anyone faced a similar situation? I'm keen to hear your story or advice..",academia,1643929852
10,should I keep going?,"I am on my 3rd school in 8 years. I have serious struggles with addiction and mental health, but I have been getting better in the last couple years. So, I was feeling pretty good about where I’m at with my degree… until today. When I woke up this morning I felt good about all the progress I’ve made and how good my grades have been. Then, a couple hours ago, it came to my attention that I still only have half the credits I need… I can’t work and take more than 2-3 classes at one time, and I have to take summers off from school because that’s the peak season for my job.

12,Ethics and fraud in academics?,"I'm currently working on my PhD in applied machine learning as part of a research group, let's call them research group One (I'll name each group by number to avoid confusion). As a side project, I""m also working on a different application using the same ML techniques as part of a different research group Two. For this project, we are using data from a well-known publicly available dataset, but to save time, I received a derived/cleaned-up version and data pipeline script from Two. Two received this dataset from research group Three, who are multiple academics from well-respected universities, that created this dataset/script and used this to publish at least 1 peer-reviewed paper. Two has also published at least 3 papers using this derived dataset by now.

I wanted to replicate the results achieved by Two and Three using this dataset, but I consistently failed doing so. After many failed experiments, I decided to further investigate the dataset I received. I reviewed the script and compared the derived dataset to the original dataset and I noticed the following shortcomings:

\- Various variables have been linked incorrectly. I was able to establish this because 1) the values of these variables didn't correspond to the values of the variables when I recreated the dataset and  2) the expected relationships for these variables did not match the literature, while the ones in my dataset did.

\- About 90% of the data was missing, which they alleviated through imputation. This imputation is acknowledged in the original paper (on the fly, using half a sentence), but they did not discuss the extent to which data was missing. They also do not acknowledge that their imputation technique inflates their results significantly (enough to account for 90% of their total performance, and to shift their results from random to significant).

I've relayed my concerns about this dataset to research group Two, but they were not eager to address them. They said that I could contact the original authors to ask for clarification, but also said that it was redundant and shouldn't impact their publications because 'the data was not the main focus of these papers', and that it's fine because ""it's already part of peer-reviewed literature"". They continue(d) to use this data despite my concerns, as well as the concerns of a colleague, who received the same lukewarm response when bringing up similar issues.

In addition, I learned that the work of Two on this dataset has also been 'interesting' as they stated that they ran experiments multiple times to 'get the results they desired'. This is something I've also encountered at One however, so I started to see it as a real yet unethical part of 'current science', but I'm not sure if I should.

I have some questions regarding this whole ordeal, and I would love to get some feedback and fresh perspectives from the community.

Am I blowing things out of proportion here, or is this something that should be addressed?

What would be my best course of action, if I should take any? 

When does repeating experiments to get the desired result go from unethical to fraudulent?",academia,1643908930
13,Pros and cons of recommendation letter from former student/advisee for TT job,"I'm a postdoc trying to put together a first application for a TT job. 

Throughout my careers, I have asked recommendation letters from my supervisors, whether they were TA's, lecturers/professors in class, undergrad thesis supervisor, PhD thesis supervisor, etc.  I can easily ask recommendation letters from my former PhD advisor and my current lab PI, as well as other well-regarded collaborators and colleagues in my field again. 

However, throughout my postdoc I also spent a large amount of time informally advising and guiding a couple of PhD and Masters students. If the selection committees are looking for someone in TT position who can be a good mentor in academia, then is it better for me to ask recommendation letters from people that I have advised, at least 1 out of the 3 required recommendation letters?

I found no syllabus in the webpage. I doubt if it is because the EMBA program trys to avoid public scrutiny that that I ended up finding nothing in the webpage.

Some people even mocked that was like ""Entertainment"" Master of Bussiness Administration, which people go to to have fun. Anyways , all that I have managed to know is that there is some criticism on EMBA in my country.

19,Master's Dissertation Stress... unable to cope.,"Hi all, wondering if you can offer me some help.

I'm in my final year of university during which I have to write a dissertation. I've selected a topic. My supervisor wants me to draft a 2-page document comprising rationale, literature review, questions and objectives.

I cannot for the life of me figure out what to write regarding objectives. Words have stopped making sense and even looking like words. I genuinely feel suicidal because of this...I keep thinking if I can't even write this 2-page document, how am I going to complete my dissertation?

Another thing also stressing me out is that my supervisor initially suggested I follow one line of research, I produced the 2-page document, then she suggests something entirely different and not what I want to follow...I fear that I won't get approval to start actually writing because of this and also because my formulation of research question is also ""too"" something - ""too broad"", ""too unquantifiable"". I feel clueless and as though I'm just at a dead end.

I feel like a failure, unable to write this at all. I really just want to drop out - but I'd hate to have spent 3.5 years stressing and getting good results over this...but it's at the point now that I visualise myself dying and I feel relief because it means I won't have to deal with this anymore.

This has been a massive rant and for that I apologise. I'm just so stressed...does anyone have any advice or any anecdotes regarding their own struggle with their dissertation? Thanks.",academia,1643828653

21,Expectations of my possible future in academia,"Quick background: Just finished my masters in business information systems, have one publication (first author) on the topic of literature discovery, working on a second publication on sustainability and data.

There's a chance my uni wants to hire me as a postgrad researcher. I find the research staff split between young+cool and old+full of BS.

Below are assorted questions. Please feel free to only answer a subset:

1. What kind of things should I pay attention to in the school/staff/subjects which would impact my job satisfaction?
2. My recent publication was on literature discovery. Overall, I find ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" lacking process, and easy to be faked (select literature A but not B). Possibly due to the explosion of information availability and the lack of attention on reproducing results.  
Is this an accurate observation?
3. I often find research becoming pedantic beyond necessity. Does this go away?
4. Mainly in the area of IT, it seems like the research of my professors is pointless, e.g., exploring domain-based chatbot applications while industry has moved beyond the need of chatbots. The researcher will publish 3 papers and in the end, makes zero impact.  
Is this an accurate observation?
5. Is the goal of research to actually move collective knowledge forward, or just to increase the count of publications on my CV?

Thanks!",academia,1643813617

SP3 and SP4 were really surprised to find out that content was removed, and share my views that now the paper will be rejected because it presents fuck all.

SP3 and SP4 are fully on-board with my work. Additionally a fifth person was brought in by SP2 to lend his thoughts on what I was presenting- and SP5 thought it was amazing.

This change has come pretty last minute as the semester begins in about two weeks.

I don't know who to talk to about my concerns, and have no idea how to talk to my supervisors without feeling rude/ offensive/ confrontational.

34,Should I get a PhD in neuroscience or go to medical school? Opinions needed!,"For the past 2 or 3 years, I have been weighing the pros and cons of medical school and graduate school. They always seem to even out and the choice has never been clear to me. Now, it's time to study and take the MCAT or begin applying to graduate school. What do you think I should do?


Cons of medical school/MD:

Hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt

Length of education needed: 8+ years of school and residency (+possible fellowship)

I have memory problems from brain surgery, so huge exams like the MCAT and USMLE would be exceedingly difficult (if not impossible)

I have two past misdemeanors that I cannot get expunged until 2024 and 2026, and I'm unsure how these could affect my entry into medical school/residency (could also affect grad school too though) 

Long hours, demanding, often overworked 


Pros of medical school/MD:

I'd enjoy the job and I'm genuinely interested in the field (of both medicine and psychiatry) 

Job security

Stable job market

Always in demand (unless NPs/PAs take over) 

Pay

Ability to both prescribe medicine as well as conduct research 

Autonomy


Cons of Neuroscience PhD/Research:

Little job security 

Job market is apparently quite oversaturated—may spend 8+ years in school for nothing/just to work in a totally unrelated field (is this true?) 

Low paying 

I'm not a good teacher and a total introvert (wouldn't enjoy being a professor much) 

No ability to prescribe medicine, and I'm particularly interested in the psychiatric treatment of mental disorders 


Pros of Neuroscience PhD/Research:

Genuine interest in neuroscience research, the brain, mental health disorders and their sources and treatment

No debt! 

I'd have a much easier time in grad school vs. medical school 

I enjoy writing and researching and am naturally much better at both than I am memorizing information

Probably not forced to work as many hours as an MD is


So, considering these things as well as your own knowledge of the field, what decision would you make if you were me and why would you make that decision? Are there any pros/cons that I'm not considering?  Is there anything that I seem to be unaware of/wrong about? Am I not putting enough weight into certain factors? 

More info about me: I am a 23 year-old neuroscience and psychology major in my junior year (I took ~2 years to recover from brain surgery). I have a 3.7 GPA, and I've shadowed both physicians and PhD's. So far, I've written and published two research papers and I'm working on a third (although these are with an MD, not a PhD!). I have worked in patient care at a rehab facility and I just got offered a lab assistant job.

35,I keep getting asked to peer review a manuscript that has been plagiarised from my own publication.,"So I've spoken to a few colleagues about this, but it seems to be a weird one.

Open it up and every single sentence is just a shuffled or reworded version of my publication, throughout the entire paper. Even the figures are identical to our paper, except for colours being changed. They then had the audacity to cite our paper in their comparison tables. Obviously I reported this to the journal and it was rejected.

Except then it happened again, with the exact same manuscript submitted *by a different group of authors* from a different institution in a different country. Reported it, it got rejected.

Since then there's been a handful more times that I've been asked to review it (same two author groups) and go through the reporting cycle. It's honestly a huge time drain and I find it stressful, plus I'd hate for it to slip past peer review if I wasn't asked to review it at some point.

This week, someone leaked an email where he's talking to a foreign company and they are setting up a joint venture to develop this finding.

I've put my name down for seminars, conferences, I've put my name down to demonstrate in the labs, I'm sitting in on 3 undergraduate modules, learning a second language (and R, so feels like 3).

Is there anything I shouldn't waste my time with? Anything extra I could be doing? I'm a bit tight on time with 2-3 other part time jobs and my additional modules and don't want to take too much time away from my Research.

Are there ways for me to email anyone in the Uni? I was thinking of emailing a professor and asking what he thinks of future research between two somewhat similar fields I'm interested in but don't want to seem incapable of finding out myself. Would it be odd or peculiar to volunteer for lab work in a Uni you don't go to?

Whilst I know ranks and PhDs aren't really too important, I didn't have much choice of relocating for my masters. So I would like to get to know a future supervisor before signing up for a PhD..

Sorry for the word vomit but any advice is helpful thank you guys! 
tl;dr how can I get my foot in the door at a better Uni for my PhD?",academia,1643649283

I know that the quote doesn't exist in any other paper therefore turn-it-in will directly show that I have used the same thing in my previous work.

47,Non academic career options for music graduates?,"Hi, I'm currently studying a masters in musicology and have been accepted to do a phd in music which (for various financial reasons) I may or may not be able to actually do. I do love studying music and would be very happy with a career as a musicologist, but I'm well aware that the jobs market in academia (especially in the arts) is pretty dire, so I'm very open to the idea of having a job in a different field/sector, provided it's something I'm good at and pays enough to live off of.

Given the difficulty in having a career in music academia, my plan was to study a PhD with the hopes of becoming an academic, whilst staying open to other opportunities and potential career options that I could pursue, should academia not work out. But now that it's possible I won't even be able to do a PhD, I'm realising I should start thinking serious about what other areas I can try to go into, and what skills I can attempt to cultivate, that might aid me in finding a job after this masters.

Doing something related to music would be great, though whilst I'm very musically capable I dislike performing and instrumental teaching, so that doesn't leave a lot of options. I'd be happy doing a job outside of music if it was something I was good at and that I had the skills for, though I have no idea right now what that could be. I'm creative, intelligent, good at doing research and writing etc (I have all the skills necessary to do well in a musicology masters programme, though don't currently know how best to market those skills to an employer). Do you have any suggestions about what possible career-alternatives I can think about/look into? I'm pretty open (and still have over 7 months till I finish this degree) so any and all ideas are appreciated.

57,Asking for a reference letter from my supervisor who offered me a postdoc position to use for a different postdoc position.,"&lt;throwaway obviously&gt;

TLDR: I have no income after I graduate and my supervisor offered me a postdoc position. Would it be acceptable to ask for a referral letter for other positions despite considering my supervisor's offer as a backup plan?

.

I'm about to graduate my PhD in two months and unfortunately I have not secured any employment right after I graduate yet on and am only now able to start looking forward to the future, since it is only this year when my research will finally bear fruit in terms of publications. I switched fields, hence, the slow start.

My supervisor is aware of this which is why he offered me a postdoc position right after I graduate to work on a new project. I feel like I have been an ""okay"" PhD student under him but I feel like I was just that (see: only getting my first publication as I'm about to graduate) so this was a really good offer on his part and I'm very thankful for it. Especially since I will have no source of income right after I graduate and my savings will only last me a couple of months.

However, as some here might share the same sentiment, even though I like the field I'm in and enjoy the experiments I do, I would really want to get a change of scenery and meet new people. Doing my postdoc in the same laboratory seems like just extending my PhD which I'm starting to feel fatigue in. 

So, I'm applying for industry jobs but I'm also considering postdocs in other places. Of course, almost all postdocs require a reference letter from the current supervisor. So my dilemma is: would it be okay to ask for a referral letter for other positions from my supervisor considering that he already offered me a postdoc position? Also considering that I have no certainty standing offers from any other position yet after I graduate; and that this postdoc position in my current lab kind of gives me a backup lifeline in case I don't get any offers. I also want to maintain good relations with my supervisor of course.

If you were my supervisor and you extended a helping hand to me (offer of postdoc), would you be offended if I asked for a referral letter for a different position?",academia,1643474840

60,Undergraduate research supervisor denied my request for a reference letter,"I don’t know if this is the place to get some advice on something like this, but I’m 22 and a junior majoring in biology. I was first asked to intern with one of my professors last June and he seemed to enjoy working with me so he hired me on to work on a project as a research assistant. I was also working with a graduate student whom he had worked with before and she is my sort of direct supervisor, and I work with her the most. 

This specific professor also oversees a really cool residential summer internship at a national park and has told me I would be a great fit for this internship and I want it very bad. It would be the best opportunity. I have been good about following up with him and we recently had a great conversation about the current project we are doing, presenting our other project at NCUR as well as preparing for me to apply to this summer internship. We were both planning on me getting one of my letters of recommendation from that graduate student as I worked with her a lot and he felt it would be more impactful if the letter was from her and not him. 

I was nervous about asking her as I wasn’t sure how she felt about me due to some scheduling difficulties the past couple months. I know excuses are kind of BS but I live on my own and have to work a full time job to pay my bills and for school since I don’t qualify for any assistance. Luckily I own my own business and it allows me to be pretty flexible, but there are still scheduling difficulties and there were a few times where I just wasn’t available when there was work that needed to be done and I had committed to jobs that wouldn’t allow me to help. I know the rule is “be easy to work with” and I’m sure from her point of view, I just wasn’t easy to work with. 

So fast forward to yesterday after after a great conversation with my professor about the internship and him expressing that he felt confident in my ability to get it. I started my application and texted this girl to ask if she would be willing to write me a letter. She replied saying she doesn’t write letters for people she doesn’t know that well or hasn’t worked with much. The issue is we have been working together for about 6 months now, and previously she had even invited me to her house to look over my CV and meet her friend who had done that internship before, so I feel like she switched up on me. 

I feel finished in academia now. I’m scared to admit to my professor that she won’t write it because he’s going to question why she won’t, and she would have been the best letter as our work related most to the internship. I feel like I’ve screwed everything up and I just don’t even know what to do at this point. Any advice?",academia,1643383099
61,Is it wrong to not have any research ambitions after PhD and postdoc experience?,"I did my PhD and 1 year postdoc in mechanical engineering from a top 20 world ranking school. Though it took me longer than others to get my PhD (5.5 years), I published 5 first authored papers there. Subsequently, during my postdoc, I published one first authored and two co-authored papers.

I think I have a decent research CV. I have fair chance of getting a tenure track position in a low ranking university in North America or something in my home country. 

For the past few months, I have been working as a sales and support engineer company for scientific products company. I  don't do research, but I help other researchers setup the equipments in their labs, troubleshoot issues with their million dollars equipment and work towards selling products to different universities in North America. 

The job is decently paid, full time remote with good working hours. I might have to visit few sites in the future but at the moment it's completely remote. You can say that my job is of a highly qualified customer support, where the customer is university, scientists and academics.

I am somewhat enjoying my new role. There's lots of growth within the company and I can move to management in the future. However, back of my mind, I feel that I am doing something wrong. Since I have done a PhD, I should work in a research field. I should work as a research scientist in industry if academia is not my thing. I should try for tenure track position as that was my goal during the start of my PhD. Being a scientist was my childhood dream, I should not let it go. 

However, I am not finding any appeal in research anymore. Even though I am sure I can be successful in my field, I don't enjoy it anymore. I like doing research but the aspects of writing a paper, grant, teaching, lack of technical skills in many areas makes me loose interest in the career path.

For example, I have a personal statement in my CV, which is just a short blurb giving an overview of me and he told me that using the word ""passionate"" to describe myself in it is ""unprofessional"". In fact, he told me that including the statement at all is unprofessional. My research plan has three detailed projects, with potential collaborators, timelines, and funding sources, some nice figures, and (I believe, he agrees) a sound basis. In addition to all this, I have a short paragraph at the end of my long-term research vision that is a bit aspirational, describing kind of a bigger picture view of what a very long-term path in the field could bring about. He also said this is ""unprofessional"" and that I shouldn't include it.

Throughout my academic career I've just always had trouble keeping up with all the information and trying to remember it. I could learn something one week, actually understand it and be able to apply it. The next week I wouldn't be able to cuz I forgot. I never participate in discussion cuz I never seem to fully understand what people are talking about. It makes sense when they talk about it buy when I do the assigned readings I don't get it. Doing the assigned readings is a hassle too cuz it'll take me hours to get through 20 page articles when it usually takes other people in my class an hour. I keep reading and not understand how all the words connect. It's not just with academic stuff. I have this issue with fiction as well. Assignments take forever too. Between procrastination and rereading things a million times, my assignments are always turned in late. I remember a few years ago in undergrad where I was working on a group project where I had to keep track of how many hours I spent researching/working on it. I logged at least three times more hours than the other ppl in my group for the same amount of work. 

I don't even know how I've gotten this far because it seems like I'm putting the bare minimum of effort into any of my schoolwork but spending way too much time on it. I've somehow passed all my classes. I know I'm not dumb and I can hold intellectual conversations with my SO and say insightful things but most of the time there's just so much noise in my head that I just can't focus. I forget things I want to say, even when I have the notes in front of me. I forget words, even simple words. I can pull up the image of what it is in my head but it's blurry. I can see the word I'm looking for, I know what it is, it's there somewhere, but I just can't see it. 

I've been trying to work on my thesis (in anthropology/archaeology) and I just can't see the angles that I can take with my information. I know there's something there but I don't know the theories or approaches to apply. Either I never learned them or I forgot them. I'm the only person from my year who hasn't finished their thesis. It's especially frustrating cuz I live with my parents and they're supporting me financially through my degrees. I don't work besides the occasional days where I volunteer. I have nothing else to do except focus on my school stuff. 

But compared to everyone else I feel so behind and dumb and idk how to catch up. Finding out I have adhd has showed me how much of my life has been affected by the symptoms: missed deadlines, forgetting to apply to things, not being able to pay attention to the little things, and not retaining information. Not just affecting my academic stuff but my personal stuff too. Forgetting to pay my medical insurance, making appts, renewing my passport, taking things to the mail, underestimating how long things actually take to do.  I'm trying out medications but idk if they're working. I just feel so hopeless and wonder at what point I should just give up.

84,Looking for participants for a study on work-life balance,"Dear all,

I am currently working on a photo-production study to explore ideas of work-life balance in academia and I am looking for a few participants (thanks a lot to the Mods for letting me post it here!). Specifically, I'd love to hear from **UK-based women academics who provide regular care for an adult** (partner, parent, another member of their family, friend etc.)  The study involves taking a few photos illustrating your idea of work-life balance and then taking part in an online interview (approx. 45-60 minutes) to talk about the photos and your understanding and experience of work-life balance. We've got Amazon vouchers to thank our participants for their time and effort :)

The photos - at your permission - will be used not to create a traditional and online exhibition to provide space for reflection, discussion, and inspiration for the general public including academic and non-academic staff in HE. 

**If you are interested in taking part please email me at** [**awezyk@bounemouth.ac.uk**](mailto:awezyk@bounemouth.ac.uk)**. If you know someone who would be willing to participate, please share my contact details with them**.

Many thanks and have a lovely day everyone!

86,Supervisor ignoring all communication for years,"I want to publish a paper. Spoke to supervisor in person and he was happy about the idea. Sent them the paper and left uni officially (completed phd). Sent several emails asking for update (\~5?) in the two years to him and got no reply. In between that time I sent the paper to a post-doc, got a reply, did some corrections and had sent the paper to the supervisor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Within that time he has been communicating with others (after speaking to them) and also mentioned to one person my paper. 

&amp;#x200B;

I emailed the supervisor again recently after a year and no response.  I emailed the post-doc recently and he tried to communicate with the supervisor and was not able to get a response. 

&amp;#x200B;

The post-doc now gave sort of an ""ultimatum"" in an email to say that if we do not here a reply within a certain deadline, we will submit the paper. So far, no response and the deadline is approaching.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure what are the ethics and morals here. The supervisor has had no input in the work. Their name only appears on the paper because I did the work in their lab and it uses data from my phd which he supervised.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no previous issues with the supervisor during the phd (other than he was busy but that was fine). The supervisor previously worked with he post-doc for many many years before the post-doc left to another university and as far as I know, there were no issues between those two either.

96,I'm in my 4th year of being a research assistant and I'm so bored of the rules about doing research. It doesn't make sense to me. Does anyone else feel indifferent to academic work / academia?,"The whole concept of ""academic writing"" feels so contrived to me. Whenever I need to write a paper, I always have such a hard time reviewing literature, paraphrasing everything, pulling one sentence from one paper and one from another. I need to read through 10s of previously done research just to form one single paragraph. 

Can't I just write everything I know right off the bat? Or WHY do I have to paraphrase every single thing that I'm citing? It's obviously a citation which I found from another person's work, so why do I have to change the words? These constant rules about how to write a research paper, how not to ""plagiarize"" etc. makes me wonder why I'm in the academic world. It's only plagiarism if you present somebody else's work AS YOUR OWN. But as long as you credit the author, what's the point of spending countless hours on paraphrasing? I find this to be a complete waste of precious time that would rather be spent on actually focusing on the research itself. Plus, thousands of papers are published every year, yet only a bunch of people read them. I spend months on a 15-20 page paper only for it to be read by 5 people who are either interested in the subject or think that my paper is relevant to their own research, so they can ""benefit"" from my citations.

Anybody else feel like this? I feel like a complete outsider when I talk about this with my colleagues who I'm closer with. They say that it doesn't bother them, it's just the way it is. But I'm so frustrated with this to the point of quitting academia. I hope I could explain what I'm feeling. Thank you for your time...",academia,1643109140

15,Collaboration problem,"Seeking advice for a tenured academic in a subject where the author list is alphabetical (here and below I'm not giving precise specifics for anonymity). What would you do in this situation?

I, alongside a slightly more senior department colleague and their old PhD advisor (now emeritus) wrote a long (100+ page survey article). In the article we made extensive mention of a follow up survey article. During the time the first paper was being reviewed/revised/published we made a 70+ page draft of the second paper. I can see from the dropbox logs that my contribution to this draft so far is equal to the other two.

Out of the blue the senior of the two co-authors e-mailed and said the two of them had discussed it and want to proceed with completing paper 2 without including me.

16,My PI is trying to steal my idea. What can I do?,"I am a postdoc working with this PI for more than 4 years now. All these 4 years have been a really bad experience for me. Always berated, always under acknowledged, under paid for most part (it's just since March last year that I am being paid full-time, before that I have worked part-time or casual hours sometimes for as little as 1000 AUD a month). There have been many other problems in this work place, mostly because the PI is an extremely toxic person. Pollutes and influences his group members against one another all the time. Someone may ask why did I spend 4+ years at such a toxic place. Simple answer: it's complex. Mostly because of my family. I have over the time learnt how to deal with this toxicity by staying focused on my work.

Now the issue here is that when I started work on current project (an ARC funded project with an industry partner), I was aiming to produce some good work so that I can secure a prestigious 4 years fellowship (DECRA). Those familiar with Australian system know DECRA is a kind of pathway to continuing appointment. And as is the case mostly, one needs to have a good project proposal supported by some initial work, on which you propose to do further in depth work, to win the fellowship. With this aim in mind, I chipped in one of my original ideas into the project. I discussed this with the PI beforehand that this idea is not included in your project proposal and my aim here is to work in such a way that I get some good work done, get papers and build upon this the proposal for DECRA. The project work will also be benefited. Win win for everyone!

Halfway through my contract (1 year only) I started feeling the PI is gonna betray me. I started to feel he will kick me out at the end of 1 year contract, won't support my DECRA and once I am out he will publicize this idea as his own and will continue to work on it while I will be left struggling again.

I did try to request him not to do this. At least not work on this idea without me on board after I move out. Requests weren't heard, things heated up a bit some time during our email conversation. He even tried to stop me doing some experiments so that there is room left for other people to work on (so that he can claim to be the rightful owner of the idea). I decided to continue work on as usual thinking if I publish a couple of big papers as first and co-corresponding author, that would be sufficient to claim the ownership of idea as well as my DECRA application.

A few days ago, sensing some trouble underneath, I reached out to head of my centre to discuss my concern. To my shock (or not actually), head had already been thoroughly lobbied by the PI. The PI probably kept on forwarding my emails to head, carefully selecting anything which could go against me. The head kept telling me the idea belongs to the university, IP will be owned by university and as you were paid for working here, you have lost the right to claim the ownership. Get what you can get out of this work and move out. He also told me (I am sure those are the PI’s words) that I may not be get DECRA anyway because my PhD is from less developed country. Now I have 33 published papers, close to 1000 citations and at least 3 high impact (2 in nature indexed journals) expected to come out soon.

I had feared exactly the same since start. Appears all my fears were true, and I wasn’t being paranoid all this time.

I understand that the PI and university and the industry partner have funded my pay (for one year only) as well consumables etc. Also I couldn’t have conceived this idea in void, being in this group definitely played large part but still, the idea belongs to me. Nobody even played a small part even in suggesting what kind of experiments to do. My question from the community here is: what are my options?

I'm working at a high-ranking university for 2 years, and recently the PI brought in a new PHD student into my project (which is ending soon) to check on my calculations. I felt disrespected at that moment because she will be contesting for authorship as well. (it's unfair for my other masters and PHD students who came before her.)  I'm doing CFD and she does FEA. I do not see the link or how she could help me with my calculations.  


In the first meeting, I had to explain to her all over again on marine dynamics because she is a civil engineering student. It is a waste of my time. And the PI is haunting on my back to quickly finish calculations but yet expects me to entertain this new student.  And I have another proposal call to rush for. From time to time, I don't have sufficient time to contribute to the new proposal call and also do calculations and handle another pro bono govt project. And when I am unable to produce the calculations quick enough he will send me messages saying "" You are employed under this project. Do this project.""    


I just feel that this is unreasonable. And it's not the first time he stepped over the line. I don't see how he has the right to control if I were to take night classes for my masters or not. I am only paid for my working hours, what I do after my working hours is none of his business. I didn't even ask him to write my recommendation letter.

You may have seen my father [elsewhere on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/s2m0xa/some_would_say_this_professor_had_a_breakdown_i/) or possibly in the news recently, for his controversial [semester introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrOzY86YcEM) which went viral.

My father is a Tenured Professor with Ferris State University, with a teaching career spanning more than 30 years.  When this video went viral, the University Administration was quick to suspend him, erase him from the University website, and publicly disavow him to the media.

[This is his press release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPDw0Wr-vO0) and general explanation of what the introductory video really is.

My father has received an enormous outpouring of support from his former students, from faculty and staff of other institutions, and from random individuals who saw his video and simply 'got it'.

The University Administration made a serious mistake in the knee-jerk reaction to what they saw as bad press, and now they don't want to admit their actions were wrong by reinstating my father, so his only recourse to resume teaching his students, and to clear his good name, is to take the Administration to court and seek justice there.

30,PhD student -- I have a pretty cake job but it's not really related to what I want to study. What do?,"I'm a PhD student in mathematics. I don't have an advisor yet but I did get a research assistant position vaguely in the field of applied math/programming. It's nice, I don't do as much work as I would as a TA and the PI's are all really relaxed, but it feels like sort of a dead-end job. I'm fairly certain it has nothing to do with anything I would want to write a dissertation on. All we do is run simulations for other research groups and occasionally collect some grant money. I'm still just guessing what I should do most of the time, and in the context of the program we're working on there's no significant mathematical work or even much technical programming to be done that I'm aware of, it's all very stable. For the past 6 months I've been writing shell scripts and updating old libraries.

I haven't yet talked to the PI's about this, and I'm probably going to send off an email later today or this weekend asking about what I should be doing. But I wanted to ask reddit first, is it really a problem if the research I do isn't related to what I want to study?",academia,1642795922
31,Should I mention being a quadruple major on my resume or is it off-putting?,"I majored in math, stats, CS, and philosophy at a decent university. Took me ~5 years. I did all four because I was really interested in the subjects and was able to finish them because I planned my schedule very well along with almost hitting the max credit limit most semesters. I also finished with a decent GPA. 

My question is whether or not I should mention being a quadruple major on my resume, especially when applying for internships and industry jobs. I think it would be cool in academia (correct me if I’m wrong though) but I don’t wanna come off as a massive nerd to recruiters. So should I only mention the majors most relevant to the positions I apply for? 

P.s. I must mention that all four majors converge towards a common interest of mine, machine learning and AI, and I’m hoping that an experienced eye can see that. Plus, I just started a graduate program for ML and computational stats to build on that.",academia,1642795455

Basically, I feel like there's just no interest from professors I'm hoping to work under. The issue I keep running into is that I'll submit an application for a fellowship, but I won't hear anything back - and the deadline for the general app passes. 

The professor I'm working for now recommended that I should wait to finish my *program* application until there's at least some expressed interest from the professors I've applied to work under, but I'm worried that I'm missing the boat with that method - I've barely gotten any responses, and pretty much all of my applications are past-due at this point :(. 

Admittedly I'm not sure what to do - I don't think it's an experience/presentation issue. I was wondering if anyone here had any ideas for what to do next - is it even worth it to finish my applications, or should I just wait another year/try to go for a Spring 2023 date?

It has been 2.5years and I have been unable to get any results. A part of this is due to covid which lead to our lab being closed for around 6-7months.

35,I'm fed up with my current work as a research assistant,"Hello everyone, I needed a place to rant because I feel stuck without a way out. I am using a throwaway account here just to be safe.

TL;DR: my boss assigned me to work on an impossible task which is unrelated to what I was supposed to do and shrugged off my attempts to communicate the problem.

Upon graduation, I started to work as a research assistant (RA) for a professor in a local university. I accepted the job under the impression that I would be doing a neuroscience project, but my boss initially asked me to work on other ongoing projects which have little to no relation to the project I signed up for. As that project had yet to officially start, I didn't give too much thought about it, and assumed that working on other stuff was normal for RAs.

Some time passed, and my boss asked me to help out with yet another project (which was also unrelated to what I signed up for). My boss said the project was in data processing and analysis stage, but it was urgent and had to be wrapped up ASAP. Soon after, I realized that the project's experimental design was very complicated and involved a massive amount of data (more than several terabytes). Furthermore, all the data had to be \*manually\* processed. I've tried to ask some computer engineers for advice, but understandably they couldn't help because they had their own stuff to do. Worse still, as I starting working on it I found more and more data that our analysis team thought were processed but actually weren't, which adds to the frustration. Feeling fed up, I calculated the time that was needed to complete the whole thing, and found out that it at least takes 2000+ hours.

I have tried to explain this predicament to my boss face-to-face, but every time they were like ""I know it is tedious, just try to do it"" or ""keep doing it, thank you for the hard work"" or ""thank you, keep up the work"". Our team even provided the calculation of the total number of work hours required and how impossible the deadline is, but to no avail. My boss even told the senior RA to give me some ""push"" to get the work done. I feel like I am at my wits end with this unrealistic workload but there's nothing I can do except to chip away at it, even though it's by a miniscule amount every day. The thing is, it seems this was not my boss's the first project that involves manually handling large and complicated data, and the deadlines of those projects are drawing close as well. I started to loathe going to work.

I'm afraid I cannot go into specifics here in order to remain anonymous, but thanks for reading this, and thank you reddit for being my outlet.",academia,1642772411

38,Consulting or tenure-track?,"I've been in a soft money non-tenure-track research faculty position for seven years. I was recently made an offer by a consulting company. However, I was also just offered a tenure-track position in my department. I wasn't expecting it, which is why I was applying to other positions. 

I'd be an opportunity hire, so I'm not competing with anyone, but I do have to interview. The consulting position would pay about the same starting out, but would probably increase faster.

The company said that working more than 40 hours per week is rare, and it's 100% remote, which is something I really like because we would like to move. Work-life balance is important to me because we have a toddler and would like another. And I've often felt really overwhelmed with work. The ability to set work aside when I get home is really tempting.

However, I'm much more excited about the possibilities of tenure-track position. And it's a one-way exit. It'd be really difficult to get back into my field. It could really be a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Several months ago I talked to my professor and expressed my interest; he kindly suggested to email him later about any possible research. I did so. He replied with many questions about my knowledge and how busy I am in this semester, examined my resume, and emailed back (very promptly) saying he has something. He asked for specific courses - if I had taken them and I said no. After several hours, he responded that he talked to the professor of a completely different department (but both are STEM, engineering) that I do not even know. This unknown professor has a Ph.D. student with whom my professor suggested to communicate and work on something related to my major.

I am very confused. My professor does not work in this area, as far as I know. I don't understand; is it cool that he send me to someone else (because, he mentioned ""our goal is..."" in his email, so I'm assuming, maybe he is involved in this area (?) but I highly doubt it)? The courses he mentioned to which I said ""no, I haven't taken"" are exactly what he is doing in fact (but unavailable for me as an **undergrad**). Also, from the tone he used, I felt like maybe it's really good that he talked to another professor, as my professor said: ""he **kindly** accepted.""

45,Mentoring my PhD students in 2022...,"COVID has really changed the way I work with students. Before the pandemic, we'd have regular meetings, hash out details of mathematical problems on the board, and I was always clear on the level of understanding that my students had of the problems that I have given them.

Once the pandemic started, my time became severely constrained due to childcare and continues to be. It's taken me a while to get my footing, and finding a way to effectively communicate with my students. The first step that I took was to develop YouTube content that breaks down my research as well as I could, which gives my students something to review and study beyond the papers. When I teach classes, I assume a lot less prerequisite information like in Functional Analysis, where I have no idea how their classes faired during the pandemic.

At least, this lets me have fun going into the aspects of the subject that I really enjoy.

All this YouTube work has also given me a whole set of periphery skills and technology that I can use during Zoom talks and during meetings with my students. Pictured here is my DSLR setup to look at my whiteboard with an Elgado 4k capture card piping into Microsoft Teams for a graduate student who prefers to meet remotely, and my audio is all coming through my AirPods.

During the pandemic, I went from 2 students to 4, where I am helping a colleague by co-mentoring and funding their student, while they work through more difficulties than I'm facing, and another student joined me recently, and I've only seen him in person once.

I just wish I had more time for my students, but I feel like we are finally getting on our feet again.

53,I'm a TA in a department other than my field of study. My boss made some comments today about my evaluations that I need help unpacking.,"Ok, here's the situation: I am getting a PhD in a liberal arts field of study, and am entering medical school in August. I have a good background in science due to the pre med courses I had to take, etc, so I was hired by a science department at my university to teach a non-majors intro section.

I got last semester's evaluations in today. Last semester was my first time teaching the class. They were about .7 points (out of 5) lower than the other TAs.

I was told this by my boss, a professor in the department. He described that as ""abysmal."" I asked him what the chief complaint of the students was. He told me he quote ""hadn't read the evaluations yet, but it's probably because you never smile. I mean, the first time you smiled last semester and acted happy was when you got into medical school. Students pick up on that.""

I'm a woman, and my immediate reaction to this was that it feels really sexist for a male professor to tell his young female TA that she got poor evaluations -- which he hadn't even taken the time to read yet-- because she didn't smile enough. But I'm also confused by the comment because we 1) wore masks all semester in TA meetings and 2) I act professional in TA meetings because that's how I've been conditioned to behave. Sure, the other TAs bring him cookies, joke, and giggle during the TA meetings. That's fine, cool. They've known him for longer. But my approach is always polite yet professional and frankly it's gotten me pretty far in life. (Also, I think it's low key inappropriate to bring cookies to your boss for the explicit reason you want him to like you/rehire you, which is what I was told by one TA?)

Now, I read my evaluations. The verdict is that students wrote stellar comments about my approachability, friendliness, and dedication. They wrote terrible comments about the structure of the class, the syllabus, the grading policies and the difficulty of examinations -- these are all things outside of my control and set by my boss. The only comment that was negative was that one student wrote the class was ""boring"" and I just read from slides in a monotone voice, which was an outlier. And one student did complain about me not responding to emails, but I'm pretty sure this student was the student that refused to send them to my actual email address/kept sending them to a defunct one I told her I no longer check.

Now, I didn't make it clear to my students that the evaluation was for my TEACHING and not the course itself. And I think it's possible some of the lower numerical ratings are due to that.

But besides this, he also cautioned me against telling students that I was earning a PhD in a liberal arts field and not a science field. It had gotten back to him that some students were complaining that they were being taught by someone who doesn't have an academic background in science. He said students ""sink their hooks"" into information like that and decide early on if they like the class/instructor. I'm sorry, but what?

I just needed to vent. I also need guidance on how to handle this, and if I should do anything or just let this situation slide. I won't be teaching after May. And I think right now the most I'd want to do is to send a polite email once I'm off his payroll and explain that his comments frustrated me and came across as sexist. IDK",academia,1642637851

64,Starting leadership role: looking for advice,"Hi all,

Soon I'll become responsible for leading a research team at a research institute. As usual, the expected outcome is getting projects (funding) and publishing papers.

I don't feel anxious or insecure as much as I feel a bit lost and overwhelmed. It's uncharted territory for me and I don't think I've had great supervision up to now that I can try to emulate. My PhD (and partly postdoc) advisor was a terrible motivator (people would come out of meetings more confused about their direction than they were before), virtually everyone in the lab disliked them, would do borderline unethical stuff like giving ideas from a student to another, criticizing others behind their backs etc. Nonetheless, as a consequence of being addicted to their job and career (frequently on the verge of burnout) they kept getting new projects and publishing papers.

As a postdoc they never really trained me, as in teaching me how to become a leader, guiding/encouraging me in becoming independent. The supervision I was given as a postdoc was being treated as a PhD student 2.0.

So, would there be any general advice that I could start from to develop my own personality as a research leader? I'm looking for anything that could help me become a good supervisor to students, efficiently managing my time, etc but also, generally what successful cases are doing to be successful. As I said, in my personal experience team leaders are burned out and hated by everyone in the group so I am very much looking forward to cases where this is not the rule.

My adviser and I are in agreement on all but one specific aim; this aim my adviser has typically let current and past students have the most freedom in designing. This aim has been discussed with my adviser and another professor we would be collaborating with (who my adviser has encouraged me to collaborate with), and is related to the other aims my adviser has approved of.

The reasons my adviser has provided me with for not agreeing with the aim are very reasonable. To mention a few, the other professor is new to the department and needs to set up their lab; I would be working with this professor's own student to gather data that I would help to analyze, which the professor hasn't recruited yet; while the professor has spoken with my adviser stating that the data collection should be straightforward, there could be other unforeseen factors that also make data collection slow. These factors may not coincide with my finishing the degree on time.

I have thought about these reasons for the past few weeks and plan to discuss with my adviser this week a plan moving forward. I wanted to solicit this community for some advice on some possible avenues:

(1) I am very interested in doing the experiments to collect the data myself, which I haven't proposed yet to the other professor. I am uncertain of continuing on in academia for a post-doc, but the work this other professor does is the work I would like to do in a post-doc anyways, providing me with a chance to see if I would like this kind of work. I plan on mentioning this to my adviser, but am uncertain of how well this fits into my adviser's own grants (grant is flexible from what I have read related to what I would like to do), as it would fit more in line with the other professor's grants. Although I would eliminate one factor (the need to recruit another student to do this work), I'm uncertain of how long it would take me to learn the experiments to collect the data necessary, and if my adviser would even go for this. Additionally, my adviser is the primary mentor for this new professor and has a lot of clout in our department and field, so I am uncertain of handling the dynamics here even though my adviser has encouraged collaboration.

(2) Change the aim so that it is more amenable to what my adviser wishes. The aim as I have it currently is related to the other aims but is not a direct continuation of the others, which my adviser has strongly encouraged me to do. I will do this if it comes to it for the degree, but I feel strongly against the avenue as proposed as it would make my skillset much more limited.

(3) If my adviser is not receptive to (1), I am open to switching advisers. I am not too far along in the PhD and now would be an ideal time to switch. I view this as a last resort as I truly enjoy working with and respect my adviser, but the planned work for this thesis is not what I really what I was hoping for out of my PhD. I worry though that since my adviser is mentoring this new professor, and even though I have a good relationship with each individually, that the new professor would not take me on as a student given the relationship they have with my adviser.

I can further elaborate in comments or PM about the situation. Thank you!",academia,1642522328

83,How can I get back into academia?,"After my BA in Math, I graduated with a PhD in Economics. Year of graduation - 2001.

I had better offers but joined a 4x4 school after my PhD because of the two body problem. Didn't do any research but had good teaching. Tenure didn't mean much at that school.

In 2015 I had to undergo a liver transplant, so I lost my faculty position. My wife works as a school teacher and her income sustains us.

I couldn't find any faculty position after my liver transplant for two consecutive seasons, so I gave up looking and went back to my first love, mathematics. I had ample free time, so I studied math on my own. My math knowledge is now advanced enough for me to publish in the second or third tier math journals.

Last year, I again tried for faculty positions in Economics but couldn't find any. Economics is math-heavy, so I have good publishing skills. But I have been out of academia, am older and have no pubs as yet.

What should my next steps be? I am not keen on non-academic positions.

One of my students from last semester has asked me to write them a letter of recommendation for an internship application they’re submitting. I told the student I would be happy to write it, but that my recommendation as a TA probably won’t carry as much weight as that of a faculty professor. However, most of the relevant professors they might approach had classes of 80-250 students, while I taught them in a class of 25 and knew them by name. Additionally, my class is a field science lab pretty closely related to the field-based internship they’re applying for.

It interests me, although it feels quite frivolous and a bit - speaking frankly - of a circle jerk. The world does not really need another book on Renaissance chairs, and my attempts to write in a style less suited to specialists have been discouraged. Which brings me onto my real problems: my fellow grad students and academics. Bluntly, I loathe them. Literally every single person I work with is either a clinical grade narcissist or has a massive ego and seems motivated only by a desire to be perceived as clever. They live to pontificate from a lectern and cultivate an edgy liberal persona. They all have pink hair and tattoos and make out they're massive rebels, fighting for social justice while sponging off parental trust funds and pursuing careers that literally make no positive impact on the world at all. To be clear, I'm a socialist. I'd love radical social and economic reform. But despite talking a good game for most of my colleagues this seems to be essentially another pose. They live as extravagantly as they can, and rarely give time to others. It's like being surrounding by dozens of pre-Reading-Gaol Oscar Wildes. Only they don't have his powers of introspection.

97,What's in it in research for you people?,"Hi!

So recently, I've been reflecting on why do I do research. I kinda want to know what keeps you going doing research and staying in academia for so long?

I'll give you a brief background of the situation. So, I've been involved in several research projects, I think I'm quite good at it, and thinking that I can make research activities as my future livelihood. Recently, I am kind of burnt out, repeatedly trying to push myself to finish my current projects, but there's a severe lack of motivation, which leads me to reflect on why do I do this in the first place? Long story short, I told myself it was the excitement of discovering new things by myself. It didn't hold for very long, which then triggered me to ask myself again, ""is that really is my motivation?"" It is true, but I suspect that this motivation is just too shallow. It was never burdensome to study new complex things (at least recently), but it just got more and more bland.

Another thing I suspect from myself, which I haven't really found out is that it's probably I did research for something else that apparently I expected but haven't yet achieved/got. I think it is more on the unresolved problem on the personal side which I'll keep to myself to solve.

I'm still quite young which means that I still have time to bail and try other things. I know I have enough competence to do research, but I just don't want to be stuck doing something that I pretend like doing for the rest of my life. That is why, I turn to the community to seek the answer to what is it that is powerful enough to keep me going doing research and stuff. Thank you!",academia,1642411598

0,What happened here? (A negotiation that was unexpectedly stopped),"I am searching for a new tenured associate prof position at an R1 and just had the strangest experience. I got to the very end of the interview process, and I was told I was the top candidate and they were officially offering me the position. The chair wanted me to prepare a start-up proposal. We had previously discussed this. I had asked him if there were any hard limits to avoid (he said no) and I previously prepared a bulleted outline of what I’d ask for (he said it looked good). He was now asking for an excel document and budget justification similar to what you’d prepare for a grant. I did that and emailed it over. He emailed me back within 2 hours and just said “No. Good luck elsewhere.” (not in those exact words!) I was stunned and relied back “Can you clarify - did you want to counter or are you saying you don’t want to negotiate?” He replied saying he didn’t want to negotiate because we were too far apart. This was on Thursday and I’m still quite shocked! I’ve always heard advice like “just ask - they won’t take the job offer away,” but that is exactly what happened. Also, I said many times when talking with them that finances were not my priority. I would have happily taken less. Further, this was the same info on the bulleted list he had previously said okay. So, it’s so hard to understand why the door was slammed shut so abruptly. Any ideas?

Also, for context, I have another offer from another institution that was more than what I submitted here. I also had two of my mentors review it and both independently said my request was modest (and they actually also encouraged me to ask for more). So, I’m very confused and disappointed. It feels like I did something super wrong and I haven’t the slightly clue what it could be.

1,"My friend has been on the job market for five years. How can I support her/be there for her, while still being honest about her chances?","Hi, I'm hoping this is the right subreddit for academia related advice.

  
I've known my friend for seven years. Both she and I met while we were in PhD programs. She was in anthropology and I was in a liberal arts field. She graded in 2017, I graduate this year. I think she's 38. 

  
We both understood (I think) that neither of our fields have great placement rates. But it got way worse IMO starting in 2014. I recognized this and am set to start another degree that will lead to a job in August. She has been on the job market since 2017. So I have never experienced what she is experiencing right now.

  
She's had a few interviews, but never been offered a job. Since 2017 she has been working as a TA for academic department outside of her area of emphasis. It's a job that she's way overqualified for (typically it is given to first year master's students and/or talented senior undergrads, but they sometimes give it to community members) but it pays well enough at $18,000 a year AND it is only 15 hours a week of work TOPS. She also does another job that is capped at eight hours a week. So she is working about 23 hours a week. 

  
My friend gets a lot of help from her family-- I'm not sure exactly, but I think she pays part of the mortgage on a house, and her mom the other part. So she does have a safety net.

  
She vents to me occasionally about her frustrations, about how there are no jobs, etc. I want to say the right things to her, but sometimes I also feel like I need to be honest and give her the ""voice of reason"" talk no one else will. There are jobs--plenty of jobs. In fact, right now in town she could get a job basically anywhere besides academia or ""you need a degree in order to do this"" jobs that pay $15/$20 an hour. This doesn't even have to be McDonalds. Most professional business are hiring. Libraries are hiring. etc. When I suggested this, she explained that 1) they're ""shit jobs"" 2) she would get covid and it ""wouldn't be worth it"" (she is immunocompromised) 3) $15 an hour wouldn't pay her bills 4) she probably wouldn't be hired because she is overqualified and finally 5) she can't quit the 8 hour a week thing and take on a 20 hour a week because she ""doesn't have time."" AND, most of all: she's set on academia. She won't accept a job outside of academia/her area of study.

  
We've had conversations like this before. Today I pointed out that NO ONE in my department got ANY offers in academia this season, period. There were interviews, but no one was selected. The academic job market so far as I can see it is basically dead unless you went to a top 5 program and will be for another two or so years, if it EVER recovers.   

  
I feel terribly for my friend. I know it was her dream to work in academia, and I want to support her, but I want to be honest, too. What should I say when she comes to me to vent? Am I a bad friend if I am just brutally honest with her next time this comes up?",academia,1642304446

5,I need guidance with a possible tech-related academic issue,"Hello.  I'm in somewhat of a difficult situation and I will try to keep this as short as is possible.  

I graduated with a bachelor's in comp sci about 10 years ago and have a number of years of experience in software development.  Before I even attended uni I had a strong interest in a very specific kind of machine learning algorithm.  Unfortunately, at that time, my university had barely a chapter dedicated to this subject in an AI textbook, with no related master's programs available, but my hunch was correct, this particular ML algorithm has transformed the face of tech development within that time.

It was, sadly, the reason why I chose to opt to being with comp sci to begin with.  During that 10 year time frame, having a continued interest in the subject, I've had a few ideas which I've implemented on my own time.  They are potentially significant, although I do not know that for certain.  I've made comparisons with commonly known existing tech, and these tests reveal that my idea is outperforming these well-known algorithms significantly in some areas.  

Now, these 10 years later, I opted to go back to uni to take an extension course focusing on the subject.   Unfortunately, the tech professionals I've had contact with through this course aren't quite certain about what I should do with my idea, which is, admittedly, very nuanced and applies to theory moreso than applied ML.   I've attempted to ask around in other social circles related to ML, but this field is, I believe, too competitive to find like-minded enthusiasts who have any interest in pointing someone in a helpful direction.

I really feel like I'm missing out with my time at university being too early to land me where I wanted to be, and I would really like to figure out if there is a way to handle this situation in academia.  I can't simply publish my own paper, I don't think the relevant sources will accept my work since I have no phd or master's.   I do have a proof of concept that can be shown and I can produce documentation of my own findings, but how to get this to the right persons at the right schools if at least to find out that I have something valuable, or not, is a bit unclear. 

Any guidance others can offer is appreciated.",academia,1642284438

Overall reviews of the topic's early history are limited, but one paper is particularly detailed on this point. The historical information is accurate, and contains the most detailed account of trends at the time. However, much of the same paper is grossly biased towards one side of the debate, and contains several statements that are either false or clearly biased. Would it be ethical to still cite said paper for its accurate information, or is that a frowned-upon thing to do? I'm not sure what protocol for this is, especially as the review is for the public, not academic (technically). I highly dislike the paper and don't want to make it seem like it's reliable, but I also think the accurate information within it is interesting.",academia,1642274175
9,Which path…,"Hi all - I’m sort of approaching a crossroads in my life and I wanted to see if anyone had any advice or can tell me about their experiences. In a nutshell, I’m choosing between three doors: climb my way up the career ladder, apply for PhDs, apply for law school. 

ALSO I know the fields I want to work in are competitive, if your advice is to tell me I made the wrong choices in life or to give up history/archaeology and do something else entirely, please keep it to yourself. I know what I’m up against. 

I recently just completed an MPhil in Archaeology, but didn’t do amazing on my dissertation and it brought my overall mark in the course down (the main reason being that my supervisor told me the diss was good and despite editing/doing everything he told me to and him approving it, I ended up with a not great mark; I’m still very upset). I love ancient history and archaeology. My dream (I know it’s a lofty and competitive one) is to be a museum curator, and I’m currently working at a museum as an office administrator which obviously isn’t the most exciting position but it’s a foot on the ladder nonetheless and I like the job. Despite having two degrees, I know to be a curator in a national museum, a PhD is expected. Having just done poorly in my masters dissertation, I’m very nervous that if I were to apply to PhD programs they would (understandably) see this as a red flag, and also having to potentially ask for a letter of recommendation from my masters supervisor is making me sweat a little despite him writing me good ones before the dissertation. A PhD wouldn’t be the answer to the problems of the job market and competitive nature of the field but might give me a bit of a foot up, at least if I made it to the point of applying for a curator position. It would also allow me to keep studying what I love. Prior to receiving my dissertation result, I was planning on applying for PhDs anyway but now I’m shit scared that I’ll be seen as an idiot. 

There’s also the possibility of law school. I would hope to specialize in international law with an emphasis on cultural heritage and looted antiquities. I care deeply about cultural preservation and upholding/enforcing ethical practices within and between countries where these issues are concerned. I could see myself, despite the obvious challenges, also thriving in this area. 

I could also just do what I’m doing now - stick my nose to the grindstone and work my way up through museums.

Sorry that’s so long. I know my head seems like it’s all over the place because it is. Mid-20s are rough, I have no idea what I’m meant to be doing. Thank you in advance! :)",academia,1642268932

12,Unfunded Arts PhD?,"I see a lot of people on reddit saying you should never pay to do a PhD, and ideally should be paid for doing one. This definitely makes sense for STEM PhDs, where universities will actually pay a student for their work and there are plenty of funding opportunities available. But what about arts students, where funding is incredibly limited (so far I have secured none) and the university won't pay anything for your work? Is it equally not worth doing the PhD if you're not one of the very few that is able to secure funding for an arts PhD?

I'd die for one of my funding applications to be successful (doesn't look like that's going to happen) and other than doing a PhD I've got no idea what else I would do, or what other use I can put my education to besides vying amongst countless other arts PhD graduates for a job at a university.

do you use programming in your research work? in which field? how much importance is the quality of the code given?  
Is it developed to be used only once for that specific research project? Or is a long term planning done? Is the code thought so that future researchers will have realistic chances of continuing its development?  
What about projects you had to join lately in the development, was it easy to join?

23,My first academic rejection just happened,"I've had some bumps in the road, but for the most part, most of my path in academia thus far has been a relative success. Good grades, good excellence scholarship for my MA, all that. 

I submitted an article for publication at a peer reviewed journal a few months back. It's the first time I've ever tried this. Very few chances in my field to get published as an active MA student, so I wanted to give it a go. It was a reworked seminary paper, which is something the journal supports since it's geared towards MA students specifically, so I figured it could be worth the time to edit it and submit. A few weeks ago, I got extensive notes from the editorial team. I had very little time to actually work on it between my jobs, thesis and life things, but I took time off from work and powered through an intense week of editing to get it done. 

I just got the email telling me it has been rejected.

I know it's common. I know that the time investment was a learning experience still, that I could probably try to edit it some more and resubmit somewhere else in the future, that it's nothing personal. In the grand scheme of things, I only invested a relatively small amount of time in editing - about two weeks total if I count the workdays. 

But holy crap it STINGS. It feels like something about me as a person is off, you know? Like I should reconsider pursuing this as my future career. Like I don't actually have any grasp on what's a good academic paper. I love learning, researching, solving complex problems and I know I would enjoy teaching later on. But what if I'm not mentally tough enough to deal with the impending constant rejection? What if I'm not actually good enough as an academic and all the feedback thus far was mostly platitudes?

I’m an MD (non-US) with basic research skills, publications and a fine CV. 
I was recently applying for clinical/basic research postdoc positions in the states, and I scored an interview with an interesting Lab/PI. 

The interview itself lasted for 48mins, very friendly, engaging discussion, the PI projected me into the position and gave me a precise timeline for next steps(First 1-2 weeks of Jan), and I thought I did well. Minutes after the interview the PI himself emailed me and thanked me for the “good talk” and told me he’d be updating me soon. I thanked him too and expressed my renewed interest in the position. First week of Jan I sent him a season’s greetings and he replied directly, saying he’ll be “in touch soon about some more interviews” which i considered a very good sign at that time.

Yesterday while browsing job postings I see the same position posted again online.
Is that normal? Does it mean he’s probably not gonna contact me? Or that he’ll be definitely considering other candidates? 
Does any of the signs above say anything about the possibilities of getting this position? Thanks!",academia,1642108541

29,Leaving academia be like...,"Recently, I've been in an abusive situation at  my postdoctoral degree. It's a little complicated and my postdoc advisor isn't a classic abuser, but he has done things that are deeply abusive during my time here. It's been a very unpleasant few months, probably some of the most unpleasant in my life. I haven't been able to accomplish anything during this time, due to my own faults and issues, which the university has unfortunately exacerbated.  


Anyways, the thoughts of leaving academics keep coming up during this time. It feels so difficult: as a postdoc, I'm ""almost there"", almost at the point when life turns around and I become a professor. Of course, there are probably 1000 more steps after that, racing to get tenure, career disappointments, administrative problems, etc. all wait for me still.  This postdoc is basically a bust though, and I'd have to shore up my academic scholarship elsewhere more before applying to professorships.  


So, I never really liked academia in the first place, and I'm in a field (computers) where I can offramp easily into industry. I've worked in industry for two years in the past, and pretty decent companies, enough to know that it's okay and makes money but not my long term career desire.  


Anyways, it's amazing how hard it is to quit after being this far down the road. I always thought that if I quit, it would be because I had applied for various jobs, weighed my options, and decided what was best for me. I didn't think it would be because I ran into an extremely abusive supervisor, who happens to be a titan in my field (one of the few senior titans in the area). It's like my brain constructed this elaborate myth about how cool academia is (Stockholm syndrome, sunk cost fallacy, etc.) when academics clearly don't care about me at all. And honestly, academics is comparable to the other careers I've been in.  


Anyways, I was wondering how many of you went through something similar, what you chose  to do (leave or stay), and how it turned out? I'm really interested in hearing from people who left and people who stayed. Leaving feels so hard but honestly it's probably no big deal, and I suspect that if I really wanted to I could come back to the field anyways (but I'm not sure about this). It is amazingly hard to actually pull the trigger and leave, without getting forced out in some way.",academia,1642100544

What I mainly do not understand is, why doesn't the science community use already existing open source tools for publications? Why do large publications still have so much pull in the market? Is it solely about credibility, or are there other factors at play?

Started teaching part-time at a decent university in late 2021 while still in thesis defense mode. Now that I've passed and officially gotten my degree, what's the best way to approach asking my employer/boss about my prospects of going full-time? What are some professional ways to say, I guess via email, ""Hey, now that I have the degree, is there room for me to get on the tenure track at this institution?"" (Alternatively, what would be the best way to say, ""If it looks like you won't/can't hire me full-time, I will be applying elsewhere, including to Rival University; hope that's cool""?)

Some things that might be relevant:

\- I have some teaching experience from TA-ing at the university where I got the PhD. At the uni that gave me this part-time gig, I'm teaching for the second consecutive trimester, and they've asked me to teach another class for a third. I got favorable evaluations from students in the first term and have fingers crossed for this second.

\- I started teaching here during the pandemic, of course. That means I've never met my boss (the department chair) in person, just through Zoom (e.g., virtual college holiday party last month). I've also taught these past two terms entirely via Zoom. We've had a horrific surge of COVID19 cases in my country after the December holidays, so people will not be returning to offices/campuses anytime soon. This all means I have very little idea of what the campus/college/organizational culture is like and have had very few opportunities to interact with colleagues and make some kind of impression. So I understand if that might make the department hesitant to hire new full-timers in general.",academia,1642085589

I'm an archaeology translator (KOR-ENG) and I'm looking for an adequate expression for the title of a content 

\- it introduces the latest discoveries within the field of Korean Archaeology and was (before my time) called ""Archaeology Achievements 2015"", which is an extremely direct translation of what it says in Korean.. I changed it into ""Archaeological Discoveries 2020"" - I tend to use a lot of ""Konglish"" since I don't want to change to much of what the original text initially says and I don't want to edit sentence structures too much because they could lose their gestures..

So my actual problem is .. since archaeological finds (on site) are also called discoveries (in this case material, not academic or abstract) I should be looking for a different expression for the above mentioned title.. I might have to lose the whole ""Archaeological sth + year"" structure..

So I was thinking ""Results"" and ""Outcomes"" sound kinda hmm not professional enough?

""Summary of Archaeological Explorations"" ? or alike is my thought at the moment

since I'm not a native english speaker and I'm heavily influenced by the german language.. I though I might ask here

I think the answer is no, but still wanted to check, since when I was applying for jobs, there was usually contact with the HR department between the time I submitted my app and heard back. But I know this process is different from applying for jobs.

In any other environment, people would have boycotted these companies en masse and find a business that provides the same service at a better cost, but it seems that those efforts will likely always fail since there's always people who need to publish in high-impact journals to make grant agencies happy, ensure the continuity of their lab, or perhaps sometimes satisfy their own need for this arbitrary measure of ""greatness"".

46,Too many degrees to function? How do interdisciplinary people list their letters?,"Hi,

I'm a humanities person with a professional field background. For the sake of argument, let's pretend I'm an anthropologist of medicine. 

I recently landed a postdoc at a medical research institute in Continental Europe and am supposed to tell them how I want my name and degrees listed on their website. On the one hand, we are supposed to use all of our titles. On the other hand, I am worried about looking like a dick, especially given that most of my colleagues list only one, max. two degrees behind their name (because they--commendably--stayed in one country and stuck to one discipline).

Ignoring (for the moment) local laws about how official titles are supposed to be used, how would you play this? I guess I'm eager to show that I'm qualified in both medicine and anthropology, but I also don't want to overdo it (which in all fairness I should have maybe considered while spending all this time in school).

Here's a pretend list of degrees I got which roughly corresponds to the kinds of degrees I actually got as well as the kinds of places I go them from. Funnily enough, all degrees, even those at the same academic level, come with a different title/set of letters/abbreviation. If I were to use the title ""Dr."" it would be entirely on the basis of my Anthropology PhD, not on the basis of any medical degrees I got, because, well, I didn't actually do medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

M.B'08 (joint Bachelor of Medicine, Durham University/UK).

MedBac'08 (joint Bachelor of Medicine, Sorbonne University/France).

MedMag'09 (Masters in Medicine, Cambridge University/UK).

MM'11 (Masters in Medicine, Harvard University/US).

MA'15 (Masters in Anthropology as part of PhD program, Stanford University/US).

PhD'19 (Doctorate in Anthropology, Stanford University/US).

MDoc (in progress; Doctorate in Medicine, Harvard University/US).

&amp;#x200B;

My instinct is to use both ""Dr."" before my name and PhD (Stanford) behind my name, as well as all other qualifications minus the incidental Anthropology Masters and the still-in-progress Doctorate in Medicine, like so:

Dr. \[MyCupsAreFull2020\], M.B (Durham), MedBac (Sorbonne), MedMag (Cambridge), MM (Harvard), PhD (Stanford)

&amp;#x200B;

The rationale behind listing both my undergraduate degrees is that, for the sake of argument, medicine is being done very differently in the two countries I got them from as compared to the US. But maybe limiting myself to only graduate degrees, or perhaps even only doctoral degrees, would be better, like so:

Dr. \[MyCupsAreFull2020\], MedMag (Cambridge), MM (Harvard), PhD (Stanford)

OR

Dr. \[MyCupsAreFull2020\], PhD (Stanford)

&amp;#x200B;

Or is using both ""Dr."" before one's name and ""PhD"" after one's name overkill/illegitimate?

Freaking out a little because I think I made a horrible mistake and completely forgot about it until recently. For context I do battle with anxiety, so I am trying to untangle whether this threat is legitimate or fake.

I am a second-year university student and a high school student whom I know personally was in the process of applying to universities. In late-October, they had asked me to edit one of her supplemental essays for an application (which was not for the school I was attending). In the process, I think I went a little overboard and overzealously edited their essay. I mainly used the strikethrough option to cross out their original text and phrase their ideas in cleaner/more appealing ways. But in the process, I had written many sentences (next to their original sentences, which remained intact) that maintained them ideas but were otherwise new. I was also clear to mark these sentences as ""suggestions"", as they were my interpretation of the ideas they were trying to express based on her original words. Since their original text was now all marked up/ugly from my strikethroughs and different colored texts, I copy and pasted all my suggestions into one block of text under ""revised essay"". I did not think much of it afterwards, though in hindsight I was dumb.

Fast-forward to January, this person asks me to read over another supplemental essay for another application. This time, it is an application for the institution I am currently attending. Lo and behold, the essay is *very similar* to my suggestions I had written back in October. Yes, many words had been changed, and many of my suggestions were not taken, but a solid chunk of the middle was very similar. I did not know why I only realized *in that moment* that what I had done was incredibly stupid. 

I have been freaking out over the last few days and I have not been able to get any sleep. I am surprised to have made such a stupid mistake, and I honestly did not have any intent to write someone else's essay; my academic career means a lot to me and I have never engaged in any other form of academic dishonesty during my time as a student. **So question:** if this person were to get accepted into my institution, would I be liable to expulsion/suspension if the administration somehow got their hands on this very particular doc? I know that this probably some degree of plagiarism, but if I had specified that these were only suggestions + this person agreed upon submitting the application that their work was entirely *theirs*, am I still at risk? 

Thank you, and I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.",academia,1641853610
55,Psycholinguistics EEG research,"Hi everyone, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this and I apologize if this is the wrong place, but a friend of mine has received a job offer to setup their lab at an R1 institute doing psychology of language research. My research background is in biology so I don't have much insight on this. They were wondering if there are any pros and cons of considering brain vision EEG systems for their lab. This is the system that they were trained with, but they wanted to know if there is anything else that they need to consider. They do adult research and look at how people processes sentences like ""I spread the butter with a knife."" versus ""I spread the butter with a sock."" ( I hope I got that right :) Ultimately, they are looking at how people process words as they unfold in a sentence). Any advice?",academia,1641833909

61,Leaving a PhD without burning bridges?,"I am a first year PhD student. I am still finishing my MS at my last university-late-because of abuse by my advisor that led to the grad director stepping in to help me finish out of her reach. That experience was extremely traumatizing but it should be over by the end of Spring (just need to defend my thesis).

My current department is phenomenal-incredibly supportive and kind. I could not ask for better. But I have a number of issues making me consider leaving the program after this spring semester.

Covid-It appears I will likely be having issues again this year conducting my research (international travel) because of restrictions.

I have no friends or community locally which means if something happened to me, I have no help for my children or myself. This has been causing me stress and is affecting my mental health considerably.

I can not afford to live here even with student loans. The cost of living exploded since I accepted my offer here and it took me 6 months to finally find (sub-optimal-I have no bedroom) housing. But that’s all that I can afford on my salary because they will not even let you apply for anything that isn’t under 1/3 your monthly income. I also just lost most of my child support after my ex was injured and is unemployed for the foreseeable future. I am behind in my bills every month so it’s left me with considerable stress over becoming homeless and my inability to help my children with medical insurance or assistance with their college.

I am nearly 40 and feel like I’ve set my life behind in committing to 4+ years as a student unable to make an actual living. I have no real home for my children to return to, I am alone, I am poor, and I have no real future. This last point is due to speaking with a number of people in my field and taking a course last semester on career options we have. To put it bluntly, there is not a good career outlook. I am too old and tired to work in mining or mud logging, and would have no childcare to travel for 50-90% of my time (as required by many jobs). Academia is the only real alternative and positions are hard to find in my field, and after my abusive ex-advisor I am not sure I want to stay in academia.

I am in a funded position with a government group and feel like I will be letting everyone down by leaving. I do not want to burn bridges. I truly do not want to inconvenience my advisor is group-they do not deserve it. But I feel it would be better to leave soon and find a job I CAN do before I’m 80k+ more in debt with student loans only to find myself unemployable. Is it better to stick it out and take that risk and live miserable until my mid-40s when I’m already suffering? If the employment prospects are this difficult, I am worried about taking on that much more debt only to make as much as I would now without a PhD in a parallel job sector. The PhD would over-qualify me for many jobs. Or is there a way to leave properly without causing harm?",academia,1641774008

I am a highschool, but I get this vibe from him consistently - whenever I express aspirations of working hard to make an impactful end product, he kind of sets it aside and mentions something to do with my learning being more important. Not sure what to do here. He constantly says that my undergrad degree doesn't really matter and I am a born researcher, so I should focus on the learning and do grad school to be a researcher (I do not want to be a full-time researcher, even though I love this field), hinting to the fact that he doesn't expect (or want me to shoot) for something that is noteworthy at this stage. Basically, he wants me to recycle previous research or do a simple literature analysis instead of finding something novel.

I have already expressed that this internship/program is on the top of my priority list (i am investing upwards of 3 hours on it daily) and have the potential to do something a little better than recycling something old or publishing in a ""youth journal"" (which is what he aiming for, not even conference posters).

I am an assistant lecturer. At the end of each semester we send out a standard form for feedback. It’s very poorly engaged with and not really the best method to gain valuable feedback. 

One student, who consistently interrupted my workshops and on one occasion I asked them did they want to take over the demonstration (they declined). Has left feedback based on this one incident- they have called me unprofessional, and chaotic, the described me as LOVELY. They stated they are a 1:1 student and feel they are deserving of the grade and the module didn’t meet their standards. The submission was in 2 parts, the first is to a high standard the second is mediocre. 

The feedback has shaken my confidence and by that tone in the feedback I feel he would take his complaint further. My assessment process is transparent, they will challenge their grade. I run the module on my own, I don’t have a peer to ask.

85,Have you and your student/supervisor ever been invited to review the same manuscript?,"When I was in my PhD, my supervisor would forward to me manuscripts which he had been invited to review, and asked me to put in my two cents. I wrote a few words, then my supervisor added mine to his submitted it - simple as that. Now that I have graduated (for 1 year) but I am still working with him under the same roof. Earlier last week I received my first review invitation ever. Just as I was about to finish my response I did what my supervisor had done over the years, and in minutes he replied “OMG Me reviewing the same work!”. Now we are not exactly sure what to do.

As most journal policy would suggest, we are not supposed to disclose to others that we are reviewing a particular study. So this is our bad, but then hey, (1) we go to each other in office very often and it would not be surprising at all if we discover that by accident, right? and (2) we reckon that we would have similar thoughts on the manuscript so if we submit separate reviews, we are worried that the review quality might suffer.

In fact, we do not understand why the editor would pick both of us. I believe that for the purpose of peer-review, it is preferrable to pick reviewers working on different aspects that are related to the work being reviewed, rather than the same ones, as well as reviewers from different offices, so that the reviews combined would be more representative. Moreover, my supervisor's name is on all of my publications and we all have the same affiliations - it is pretty clear that we are the same team working on the same things. If these are not enough, we are definitely not the sole experts in the areas being studied. Our first impression is that the reviewer did not bother to find another worthy, suitable reviewer and just settled one reviewer slot by picking both of us, but we are not the one to say that...

At this point, we think we have two choices. (1) Let the reviewer know we discovered that by accident and ask if a reassignment of reviewership is preferred, (2) pretend that this never happened and try to think nothing about the possibility of suboptimal review quality. I am more a (1) guy but someone also reminded me that this choice could have something to do with my integrity profile...

1,"PhD, DBA or EdD","Hello all,

I am currently a business professor in the CC system from the private sector.

I have decided that I really enjoy academia, however, this means that in order to climb, a doctorate is necessary.

Although I enjoy being a professor, I believe my business background would allow me to really help my college and students if I can eventually acquire an admin role (Dean, Chancellor, VP...etc.)

Now, the PhD is the gold standard for faculty professors due to the nature of the required research, and it of course qualifies you for admin roles, however, I have seen quite a few DBA and EdD's in director, dean and executive roles from CC all the way through the university and grad study levels.

Also, some friends who are teaching from high school through the university level have told me that finding a spot in a CC is like finding gold. They seem to be really adamant about the decent pay involved with being a professor without the requirement to publish. One of my friends is a university professor, and he has told me publishing is not worth the extra compensation, ""we simply do it out of passion."" This has also made me hesitant about going for a PhD as they all seem to be full time and would require me to leave my current positions.

Am I correct in leaning towards the EdD given my admin goal?

Would a DBA be better suited to me as it may provide benefits in the private sector as well? Also, some have told me that EdDs are looked for in the private and public sector as Chief Learning Officers. 

Others have told me that the DBA in academia is also geared towards faculty positions with research as opposed to the admin role. Is this correct?

3,Stay at my current comfortable lab technician position or accept new job offer?,"I've worked as an entry-level lab technician at an academic institution for the past few years. I recently received an offer to work in another lab. Both positions are at prestigious institutions, but the research focus is quite different (i.e., different research methodologies and different practical applications). 

The supervisor I'll be working for (if I accept the offer) has been generous, allowing me a few weeks to think it over. I'm excited about the new opportunity, but a few factors make me hesitate:

**1) Lifestyle** \- my current position allows me to work completely independently from home, and the pace is very relaxed. Some days, I'm honestly not really working... as a result, I've had complete control over my schedule and a lot of free time to enjoy my hobbies and relax during the past couple years, something I've been very grateful for. In the new position, there is no option to work from home, due to the nature of the research. The pace will be very intense, but I'll have the opportunity to learn an exciting new set of skills that I can't easily pick up anywhere else. (I don't want to be too specific about what those skills are, for privacy reasons, but you can DM me if you're curious).

**2) Compensation** \- I'm still waiting to receive the new-hire paperwork, but it's likely that the new position will pay slightly more than what I currently earn. However, since the pandemic started, I've been extremely privileged to live with family rent-free, so I've finally been able to save a little. If I accept the new job, I'll have to move to a city with a very high cost of living. Even though I'll probably be earning a bit more, the COL will likely ""cancel out"" the extra earnings.

**3) Career trajectory/growth** \- Out of all factors on my mind, this is the biggest deciding factor for me. I applied to the new position because I'm considering a career change. The research focus in the new lab would make it easier for me to pivot towards a longterm career in allied healthcare/medicine, which is something that I've been thinking about for a while now (though I also have some uncertainties). This new job requires a minimum 2-year commitment, which would give me enough time to pursue additional coursework and shadowing/volunteer opportunities before I decide whether or not to pursue allied healthcare/medicine. However, in my current position, I have more opportunities to take coursework with tuition reimbursement (since I work at a major university), plus I'd have better control over my schedule to complete my coursework. I don't think tuition reimbursement is included in the new job's package... so I would have to pay out of pocket for any classes taken during the 2-year commitment.

\*\*\* **So in a nutshell:**  My current position is comfortable and familiar, has great work-life balance, though it doesn't pay well and there isn't really any more room for growth. I also know it isn't a ""forever"" position -- at some point, I'll have to move on. A new position has come up, which is more intense and much less flexible, but it will allow me to pick up a very unique skillset that could make it easier to change careers to allied healthcare/medicine. If I changed my mind after switching to the new position, I would be sacrificing some savings, work-life balance, and a couple of years where I could have maybe already secured a more stable longterm job. 

I feel like I'm somehow 'obligated' to accept this new job offer because it does seem pretty exciting at the moment, but now that I've had a taste of working from home with minimal supervision and amazing flexibility with my schedule, I also can't help wondering if it maybe makes more sense to stay at my current position, get a 'free' master's degree out of it and eventually move onto another higher paying job in data analytics or something similar. 

**Does anyone have any advice about how to think this through?** I'm open to any kind of feedback but am especially interested in hearing from people who also work (or have worked) within the research world. Despite some of the prestige that comes with working in academia, I feel like academic research is sort of a dead-end kind of place to be. If you decide not to go down the traditional academic path (i.e., pursue PhD, become a professor, etc.), then the default seems to be data analytics... I've kind of given up on the traditional academic path now but am stuck on where to pivot for a good balance between my intellectual interests and desired lifestyle.

I am currently a software developer, but my boss/supervisor wants to publish in order to gain credibility in their field. A predatory org (probably USG) contacted my supervisor (\*spammed\* is probably more appropriate), with the usual flattery and other red flags. 

We submitted an abstract to one of their fake remote conferences, which was accepted the same day... I didn't look into the conference at first, I was busy doing the programing work and I didn't want to seem suspicious toward my supervisor. I realize this is a mistake, I should have looked into it.

I'm early in my career and I don't want my name to appear on their website, as they upload public abstract books in PDF format on their websites. They asked for a short biography of the authors, in order to display it next to the abstract. So they might put this specific personal details online soon...

My supervisor also learned about the predatory things, but told me they don't care, as it might ""allow them to get contacts with the US"" (as we work in another country).

Of course, I would not like to appear on their website. What do you think is the best course of action ?

* Should I contact the predatory conference directly, and ask them to not mention my name / biography?
* Maybe I should instead try to convince my supervisor to ask to retract the abstract?
* Other researchers / students who got trapped too already appear on their website, sometimes with a headshot. Should I contact them and warn them?

This alliance can assure that those platforming our research can have the facts, open access of course. Journalists have problems with pay-walling, as they lose out on ""proper recognition"" too because of it. Even if you're a jargon-intensive field like physics or medicine, we have the opportunity to make our research better platformed and technically written for laymen to understand; it'll provide transparency of methodologies. We'd create a lot less ambiguity in the public eye of who has the hard facts.

By just making the platform, we'd be creating a sphere for those interested in journalistic and academic integrity can pursue it without the instant threat of backlash from the donor class. We'd also open up the opportunity to participate in the journalistic and academic community to those that have been overlooked or displaced by the university or big news outlets.

During grad school I always said I never wanted to teach, so I did not TA for any classes (it was not required in my program). But for the last 6 or 7 years I have not felt engaged and excited about my scientific work. I spend too much time just sitting by myself in front of a computer looking at data and my brain just shuts off. And I have started to feel like the work that I do does not matter. I don't want my knowledge and skills to go to waste, and as I've matured I've thought more about how teaching really is a very impactful activity. So I am starting to play around with the idea of switching to trying to teach classes.

37,The hardest part of publishing for me,"Addressing issues raised by reviewers in revisions, especially the comments by infamous Reviewer 2, is probably nobody's favorite activity, but there is one variant that gives me a headache that is in an entirely different league of frustration. I imagine this may partially be a problem specific to my discipline, which is a multidisciplinary mixture of at least 4 quite different fields, but I wanted to share it nevertheless. 

The problem is when the reviewer (or sometimes even the editor) has critical comments that clearly arise from their ignorance about the field in that the paper is in. And I'm not talking nitpicking and hair-splitting here. It's comparable to publishing a paper about whales, and the reviewer says that there should be a comparison with other big fish, like sharks. 

If that happens during an informal discussion, you can just say""Hey, a whale is not a fish, ..."" and optionally add some colorful language if you know the person well, and they are not going to vote for your tenure. But in addressing the, let's say, ""highly uninformed"" comment by Reviewer 2, you can't do that, because it exposes the reviewer as being ignorant, which is face-threatening to the reviewer and the editor. 

But you still have to address the point, because the editor insists on that. So I spend a lot of time basically suggesting that the reviewer has no idea what they are talking about, without actually saying that directly (""in the literature that we have reviewed, whales have traditionally been classified as mammals, and we will add a sentence to paragraph X to make this point even more clear to the readers""). But I really, *really* hate doing that, especially if there's like 5 of these comments by the same reviewer. It feels like I'm revising my paper to protect the fragile ego of someone who shouldn't even be reviewing my paper, instead of making it a better paper.

45,THE CULTURE OF VICTIMHOOD: THE POSTMODERN HAGAR COMPLEX - by Dr. Marc Gafni,"In rejecting Hagar’s tears, biblical consciousness speaks with great power to the epidemic of victimhood that threatens to cripple much of what is great and good in Western society. Hagar is abused. She is hurt. She is a victim. And Hagar has power. She has options. She can turn fate into destiny. She can embrace the desert. Her tears become not the ritual bath of her purification but the swamp of her drowning. She falls prey to the Hagar complex of victim identity. In the mid-nineteenth century, Naftali of Ropshitz, a Hassidic Zen master of sorts, was once called upon to attempt an intervention with the son of a Polish nobleman. For some reason, the boy has been crying nonstop. He refuses to be comforted. No one is quite sure what is the source of his pain. 

Days have gone by, and he simply continues to cry. All the great physicians and healers have been brought in to stop the boy’s crying and restore him to the land of the living—what we moderns like to call functionality. None succeed. It was for that reason that when all else fails, someone comes up with the not-so-popular idea of summoning the Jew, Rabbi Naftali, of nearby Ropshitz, the master known for his sharp and often unconventional wisdom. (This kind of situation was virtually always fraught with peril for the Jewish community, which was often falsely blamed for the death of Polish children. Such false complaints would set off violent pogroms against the Jewish community, which almost inevitably involved massacres and a host of other brutalities. 

But to refuse the call was equally impossible.) So Reb Naftali goes to see the child. The Hassidic master enters the home, moves past the parents and attendants, and heads straight to the boy’s chamber. There, he sits and watches the crying boy for a short time. Suddenly, he rises, approaches the lad, and whispers something in his ear. Instantly, there is silence. The boy has stopped crying. Eventually, the boy grows up to become a very powerful yet compassionate landowner in the region of Ropshitz. Through the years, no one knows what magical words or incantations the master had whispered to him, for Naftali refuses to divulge his secret. At the end of many years, as the landowner now lies on his deathbed, he calls in his children to give them his final blessings—and with his last words, the secret. “What the holy Jewish master whispered in my ear,” says the powerful landowner, “was simply this: ‘Do not cry more than it hurts.’” “Do not cry more than it hurts.” In our current culture of victimization, when claiming to be hurt is the ultimate justification for all manner of abuse, this is a most politically incorrect statement at best. Of course, we are all hurt in one way or another. 

But often, more hurt is claimed than is actually experienced, because “hurt” is the new gold currency of social interchange. Hurt itself is used as a fig leaf to cover up for the ostensibly victimized one who becomes the true perpetrator. In professional psychological literature, this is a well-described dynamic that is part of a larger system sometimes referred to as the “drama triangle.” In one expression of this dynamic, the victim and rescuer—who appear to be innocent—are often the real perpetrators. In some sense, the great biblical mystical contribution to genuine spiritual gnosis is the insistence that the divine incarnates in justice. 

Indeed, in the great teaching of ethics and eros in the school of my teacher Mordechai Lainer of Izbica, the full eros of the Shechinah, the goddess, is incarnate in the passionate commitment to justice in even the most minor court case which involved only minor financial claims. For the biblical mystic, and later for the Kabbalist and Hassidic master, eros and justice are identical. The unique Jewish contribution is tied up the mystical intuition that God is justice. 

There are metrics of hurt—not every claim is legitimate. The metrics of hurt, even when not precise, are accurate enough to have legal systems built around them. “Do not cry more than it hurts.” Hagar is the victim, but like many modern victims, she cries more than it hurts. These are the tears that are rejected by biblical consciousness.

**Reimagining Humanity’s Identity:**

**Responding to the Second Shock of Existence**

Dr. Zachary Stein  
Dr. Marc Gafni

**Abstract:** Foreshadowing arguments from the forthcoming book, Towards a New Politics of Evolutionary Love, this paper suggests that humanity is the throws of a species wide identity crisis, precipitated by a broadening awareness of our impending self-inflicted extinction. This growing awareness that humanity is responsible for its own fate and the fate of the planet is referred to as the second shock of existence. The second shock has spawned a great deal of discussion about the need for revolutions in technological, economic, and ecological infrastructures, yet this focus on exteriors addresses only half the picture. Comparable revolutions of our interiors must also take place—radical transformations in the very structure of our consciousness and specieswide self-understanding. This is a call for attending to the interior dimensions of the current global crises, recommending in the strongest possible terms that tremendous energy and resources be rechanneled into planning for the vast educational reconfigurations facing humanity in the coming decades. 

**Keywords:** Global crises; Integral Theory; Human Identity; Unique Self Theory; Cultural Evolution

One, I went straight through undergrad and graduate school. Two, I went to same university as my undergrad, and three, I got a graduate degree to close to my undergraduate degree. All this because I feel I just sort of panicked when I graduated undergrad, and I knew my grad degree would be paid for. But I really should of breathed, and thought things through.

Now I feel just super empty and directionless. While I don't regret my graduate degree per say...I learned WAY more about my subject than I did as an undergrad... I feel I missed out not really exploring other programs. I am also interested in lots of other subjects (journalism/advertising/criminal justice), and I really wish I had majored in then grad degreed in another. 

I am currently teaching at a high school, which I sort of feel very dispassionate about. I feel I could enjoy it, but not right now in my life. I just applied to an academic job which I think I am actually a very strong candidate for so there is that at least. It is sort of a dream job, but also I don't need it to eat right now.

58,Graduate students and postdocs right for IP developed while working in the research laboratory,"Merry Christmas everyone!

I have developed a software platform in my lab and I would like to get intellectual property(IP) recognition for it, but my adviser(Principal investigator(PI)) thinks it is not a right time to do so. He wants to do it later. The truth is that it was originally developed for a specific application but later I have realized that it has wide application potential and next generation is more universal. Note, I did 100% of coding and he was trying to advise but many of his ideas where never implement. The reality is, that I am leaving and I suspect he would not even include me in future IP applications if I am not in the lab. This happened to a few of my friends. They learned later that their graduate school adviser have submitted a patent application and some of their work went into the application. 

in my case, I see the software platform as an independent product but my PI sees it differently. He sees it as a part of a system and he wants to patent the entire system. I disagree. I am thinking about developing it as a separate commercial product. I would like to know that I can build on top of what I have developed at my current research institutes and not get into patent issues later.

I  suspect the same type of results could be reproduced with these “data available upon request” statements. Curious about anyone’s thoughts on  the issue. I have thought of making some kind of petition towards journal editors to force these articles to simply publish their data on a  resource like Zenodo or some Dataverse…But I’m not sure if this is the best way to deal with the problem.

I am  a final year PhD student working on experimental catalysis. However, I want to switch to theoretical catalysis in my post-doc. However, I am not sure if I have adequate experience regarding this. My present publications  don't contain any theoretical work. Therefore, my  demonstrable knowledge in theoretical chemistry is limited to the following

*   I did some theoretical work (DFT) in my Masters project,  which is also mentioned in my Masters thesis.
*  I also attended some theoretical workshops and online courses during my PhD (e.g., on Density Functional Theory). 
* I completed some data science projects on Coursera
* I have used my data science knowledge in the field of catalysis and have made some predictive analysis/meta-analysis in the form of personal git-hub project.

99,Giving up authorship of a scientific paper after making up my mind on the quality of the work - what to do?,"I just finished my PhD in molecular biology and I am now postdoc in a lab associated to my former one but under another PI. During my PhD I spent one year working on a research project that gave little results and was published in my thesis but not in a scientific paper. My former group thought there was enough material to assemble a publication. I wasn't convinced that stuff was publication-worthy, but since I did most of the work I gave it a try by contributing to write the paper. Truth is that paper looked weak to me (low sample number due to difficulties with the collections of samples from the clinic), got rejected several times and most importantly, last time comments were addressed to method errors. Even during the project, I identified several critics point with the method (field is relatively new and change rapidly) but all of my concerns were dismissed during meetings to the point I convinced myself I was too pessimistic. While doing extra work for the last review, I recognized that there are problems with the quantification method we have used. In hindsight, I would probably cancel the entire project (many preliminary results would have support to just focus on something else) and I cannot see any other way to rescue the hypotesis if not redoing the entire work using new techniques that became almost standard in the field these last years. Some of the observations still looked robust enough to me to be included briefly into a review, but this idea was rejected. I have little to no control over this, since the paper is also the result of other people's contribution.
Now it seems to me that my group is attempting to bruteforce their way to publish this work in a low impact factor journal just do get this over with. And I (the first author) am conflicted because I do not think it is worth publishing at all in this state. Because this conflict has been stated in meetings, I have been offered to rethink my position as first author or even give up entirely on authorship on that paper and I am thinking of doing so.

1,UK: PhD student - got MPhil - appeal worked,"I am a PhD student in the UK. My supervisor was way too busy to help me, but I had about 5 publications from the work I did and several citations. 

After spending 3.5 years, I participated in the viva and got a ""revise and resubmit"". I spent another year and submitted it again and I was awarded an MPhil because the external examiner thinks that the work is not good enough for a PhD. I went above and beyond what was asked and I had another manuscript ready for publishing at the end. 

On the suggestion of some friendly professors, I went to the student union and got some help and appealed and it was upheld. The university is now going to appoint another external examiner.

2,Need advice with a decesion,"I am a 21 M and am currently getting ready to finish my undergrad in economics. My gpa aucks because I want to rush my degree to move out of my home for reasons. Before I was enrolled in my current degree program I was in a stem program at a different instution but left after a mental health episode that I had and also due to the pandemic. 

When it comes to what I want to do, i feel like i have a bunch of ideas but they are mostly in the stem field. The two that I think about the most are getting a degree in engineering, going into pre med, or getting a degree in computer science. Engineering and pre med has allways been something that I thought was cool but chickened out when applying to schools because I thought I wasnt good enough which I found out later on were do to some other issues. Computer science is something new however. I just recently started to practice programming since 2018-2019 and it was cool. 

When it comes to finances, i know that I need a place to live, food to eat, and tuition and book money and I will be ok. But seeing how things are is going back to school really a good idea? I have so many ideas in my head that seem cool but they all get shot down when I think to myself all that I have is a undergrad buisness degree.

I keep hearing extreme stories about people getting stuck in endless postdocs and never landing a permanent position, or giving up significant parts of a normal fulfilling human life to eventually get one. Is this a global phenomenon? Is there a country where an academic career isn't so precarious?

16,Seeking advice. Transitioning from PhD mentor.,"I am at the end of the second year of postdoc fellowship under my PhD mentor. Postdoc has been fairly miserable. My mentor is over-extended to the point that papers are not a priority and I'm not sure it will improve in the near future. While we did successfully acquire two large grants, I am becoming increasingly concerned regarding the lack of publication (one in two years). At this point, I'm feeling so burnt out that I'm questioning whether I even want to do research anymore. I am struggling with deciding whether or not to leave. I feel trapped.  It looks like I've done so little during my postdoc, so I feel pressure to stay and try to get some of the major papers I've been working on out. 


There is a tenure track position in my partner's home city. I'd like to apply because that position likely won't be available again. My issue is whether to discuss this mentor or apply without their support. Because they very much want and expect me to stay, I'm worried that they will not receive it well and it could potentially damage our professional relationship. On the other hand, they are a well-known expert in my field and I'm worried it will hurt my application if I don't have a letter of support from them.

I hate dementia.,"My grandparents worked in fairly physically demanding jobs pre (early) retirement. My grandpa was a miner and my grandma worked with adults with physical and mental disabilities.

My grandparents practically raised me. They schlepped me to college interviews paid for food, clothes, and books while I was in school (undergrad). They promised they would help support any of us that went and they kept their word.

43,How to solve bad practices in academia?,"Hi all,

So many of us know that there are a lot of issues with academia. Most people I have spoken to who got their PhDs absolutely regret getting it and consider it a waste of their time and best years of their lives. It is almost as if these talented people were punished just because they were good. Less talented people who don't try to strive for higher goals had much better lives.   
I think overall, we all know that academia is basically a paper writing business and PhD students are cheap, naive and idealistic labor.  And it is not as ""free"". For instance if one is in a company and company doesn't treat their employees well, in a free, capitalistic system, the employee would leave the company and join a better one. But in academia it is not like that. There is 5 year commitment, and it is not easy to switch. you need recommendation letters and there is public image issue. Also we all know how tenured professors who don't have any accountability and there are many who are just publishing junk papers, and they don't benefit students in anyway, neither in their careers or something they would enjoy. Also there are professors who put their names on papers that they didn't contribute to at all. So my question is, is there a way to correct these things in academia? I think tenure system is useful in many ways, but lack of accountability towards students have corrupted the system a lot. Is there a way to correct the system?   


I truly believe that in a truly free system, there is no scope of corruption and exploitation. The only way this is happening so far is because the ill-informed students still go to such professors with corrupt practices. If there were a way for students to know that this person is not good, the way they use recommendation system for students, if there were a recommendation system for professors, the students wont go to such professors and things I mentioned above would not happen. Moreover, the professors would be more careful about the students market, that if they indeed treat their students unfairly or if the students are not eventually happy with their PhD, then they could give a bad review and that could hurt their future prospects. So they would care about not just the research/results market, but also the students market.  
So this naturally leads me to one possible solution, which is that there should be a forum where students can leave reviews of these professors. I know there are some fb groups of certain countries who already maintain such a forum, but it would be nice to have it on a public platform where anyone can access it (something like rate my professor website)

46,Whats a PhD in statistics like? Is it worth it for non-academic pursuits?,"I’ve asked parts of this question in other forms before but never as a collective so here it is. 

Some preface:

My brother-in-law was doing a PhD from the #1 university in the world in a STEM-related field. However, watching him over the course of this year, I could see he was absolutely miserable and he ended up dropping with just a masters, despite knowing that a PhD from such a university would open so many doors for him. He described his experience as reading countless papers, being lonely and isolated (apart from seeing his advisor), expected to work over time, and not having any work-life balance. He also mentioned that it just wasn’t worth it when taking into consideration his mental health vs how many more opportunities a phd would open. 

That scares me because even though I love statistics, I wouldn’t wanna put myself through 5 years of that. I’m definitely a people’s person and thrive off of socializing. I’m not sure I could survive half a decade of minimum opportunities of socializing. So my question is, is a PhD usually like that, especially in statistics? Maybe he just had a bad advisor and the university had expectations that were just too high, not sure though. I’ve also heard of some people treating it like a 9-5 and being perfectly content while making significant progress in their research still. 

Also, is a PhD in statistics even worth it if your goal is industry? I always get very mixed responses to this one because there seems to be this sentiment that PhDs should exclusively be reserved for aspiring academics (perhaps there’s a response bias here) which I honestly don’t understand/agree with. On the other hand, many people say a PhD in statistics is unique because it genuinely is worth it for industry jobs since it earns you autonomy when working on models and projects. Also, many high-earning/senior positions are reserved for PhDs only, such as data scientists at FAANG, pharmaceuticals, and even some operations/quantitative research heads at hedge funds. Plus, many top PhD programs themselves mention that their program is also tailored towards industry needs (eg: Harvard). 

Personally, I would love to do a PhD in statistics because I genuinely enjoy the subject and want to become an expert at it. However, if a PhD is usually as brutal as people describe it and the return on it for non-academic jobs is minuscule, I suppose I could settle for a masters. But I really do need some input on those two!",academia,1639710495

59,Dismayed by cheating during final exams. What do I do?," 

Hello,

I am a first year graduate student at a highly ranked graduate school in my field (social-science professional degree). I came into this program with high expectations but I have been disappointed by the conduct of professors and fellow students alike. Here is the situation:

I took a final for a difficult required course yesterday. The professor allowed several students to cheat during the exam, which took place in a large lecture hall. First, though we only filled half the lecture hall, many students sat near the top (farthest away from the professor) and openly worked on the exam together. The professor sat at the bottom of the lecture hall at a small desk and rarely looked up from his laptop, let alone walked around the room. Second, many students left the lecture hall during the exam (2 hours long) with their laptops/cell phones and began to google information during the test. The professor did not collect phones or ask that we leave them with him (or at our seats) when we left. Finally, the professor allowed some students to bring in a page-long cheat sheet. Some students observed their classmates with the cheat sheets and asked the professor what the deal was (we had never discussed this and the syllabus clearly stated a closed book final). The professor claimed he had mentioned it off hand earlier in the semester, clearly in contradiction to his syllabus.

To make matters worse, the exam is curved and those of us who studied and did not cheat will be at a disadvantage. Many of us are outraged but are afraid to bring this matter to the administration because this scenario has played out in many of our classes. I personally observed all three of the phenomenon described. Our program is supposedly high ranked, with alumni in powerful/influential organizations. What can we do?",academia,1639597173
60,Transferring to PhD from Msc...Confused," 

I am currently a first-year grad student in life sciences in Canada. I am RA-ing in a lab that is productive but very demanding as well, and I am confused whether I shall really continue to PhD in this place or search for some alternative options elsewhere. To put it into context - I already have a Masters degree from an Indian university, and I applied for this position for a PhD, but the PI was not sure I was trained enough to commence PhD directly and advised that I enrol in the MSc program with an open option to transfer into PhD within the first two years. Now, almost one year into my program, I am really confused about whether I want to continue in the lab. The research and overall productivity in the lab are excellent (I am already working towards a first-author publication), however, there are some other issues that have been constantly bugging me:

1. Our PI is VERY strict and constantly micromanages almost everything. He does not allow any sort of flexibility and wants everything to run exactly as he wants. He has a fixed way of seeing things and wants all of us to exactly be like him.
2. The lab I work in is under an autonomous organisation (still within the Uni), totally isolated, and hence I barely get to interact socially. This has left me feeling lonely and robotic, with basically zero friends that I can talk to/hang out with.
3. The city (I am not even sure whether it qualifies as a city!) I am in is very bland, and the weather here sucks big time. The winters are terrible, and there are no activities to put my mind off to.(All these issues, I feel, have really affected my mental health and peace of mind at large, and I am constantly questioning my decision of joining this place.)

As such, I have an option to transfer to PhD after my first year, or just continue with the MSc degree. I am utterly confused about this. I will surely have a decent publication by mid-2022, and getting into a PhD elsewhere (US? Europe?) should not be an issue. On the other hand, I would have to trade off 2-3 years of my life. What should I do? Any advice?",academia,1639592027
61,Preventing our lecturer from getting the ax,"Hi, I'm an undergrad student in humanities at a very large German university. One of our lecturers (a *Privatdozent* by title) has recently made known in a brief, non-polemic comment, that his contract would not be renewed for the coming semester. I and almost everyone else I have talked to were hugely dismayed, since everyone seems to agree he is one of the best lecturers, if not outright *the best* we know. He doesn't just bring extremely impressive pedagogic skills to the table, but also expertise in very relevant fields that otherwise feel quite under-represented at our institute. Simply put, a large body of students would like him to continue exercising his functions, we are just unsure how to achieve this. 

The reason for my post is to ask for ideas on how, if at all possible, we might proceed. Would some sort of petition be likely to help? It seems not to have been a decision our small institute had much of a say in, as the lecturer himself implied, so it seems more to be a matter of overarching university politics. Still, he is simply getting rotated out for no good reason, as the position he currently occupies is not itself being closed. Nonetheless, I would hate not to have at least tried stopping this unfathomably stupid decision. I'm thankful for any input.",academia,1639585246

63,Phd and/or masters?,"I earned my bachelor's degree a few days ago. My degree has intergrated master and i'm thinking of doing a phd, but i would like to do a master so as to learn more about my field. The problem is that i'm 24 and considering that the masters i want to apply lasts 2 years, i think that at the age of 26-27  I   
  might be a bit old to do a phd and a postdoc. The reason that i want to do masters, is because i don't feel ready yet so as to do a phd, from a knowledge perspective.

65,Question about my lowest homework score being dropped,"So my professor posted an announcement saying that for our final grade of the class, he is removing the lowest score on a homework assignment for each student. In this case the homework is out of 20 percent. By him doing this will the final grade get fixed and go up? since he is removing the lowest score I got on an assignment which should take away from the final grade before the removal of the lowest score on a homework? This is in Canvas btw. If so will it go up by 20 percent or half or what. It probably will go up though but not sure

I have a 58 percent now as my total grade for the class because of me getting a low score on my final exam and I was wondering if you think the fact that he is dropping the lowest homework score will bump my grade up to a 60? The lowest homework score I got is out of 20 percent like all the other homeworks.",academia,1639557082

69,PI wants to hire Undergraduates to do Postdoc work,"I am a lab manager of a lab that has only one other lab member, but I am the only one conducting wet bench experiments for 5 ongoing projects. My work weeks usually encompass 70 hours of actual time spent in the lab analyzing data, managing the lab, mentoring undergraduates, and conducting experiments. 

Primarily the issue has been that the workload is impossible for me to sustain and additional hands would be helpful to promote healthy progress on each project, rather than it being a stressful clusterfuck. This isn't helped when most of the past research has been solely led by the postdocs of the lab who left abruptly, so no one else has known or knows how to do the experiments they have done for current projects. This includes the PI. Most of the past lab members left the bare minimum in notes in retaliation to their stark situation in the lab, so I have had to train myself while pushing out data for grants and papers to be finished or started with tight deadlines. 

Instead of hiring a more experienced individual to share the burden or lead projects, my PI insists on hiring undergraduates while promising them they will be given projects to work on. The work and training required to conduct the simplest surgeries are underestimated to be simply something they can learn in no time. And when they don't deliver and make the mistakes you would expect them to make, it is my responsibility on top of everything else I have to facilitate.

73,Academia and retirement,"Hey folks. First gen postdoc here. I went kinda straight through but took longer than I’d hoped for in the PhD. This means my retirement is a thrilling 0 dollars. Good news is that they’re bringing me into the faculty next year. Great news in a hard market. 

So for the more senior folks in the room…how in the world does one actually save for retirement when the pay is so low? I gather that my salary for the foreseeable future won’t be anywhere close to an amount that helps to “catch up” my retirement, especially with student loans. This feels unstable and unsustainable.

This year, my institution informed me that I received a ""merit bonus"" of 2.3% of my annual salary, equating to just about 2,500 per year. I work in the US and this is about a third of what our annual inflation was last year. Trouble is I'm also in a grant funded position, so I don't really know how to go about asking for a better raise, at least one that would match the increase cost of living. Is this a ""normal"" size merit bonus for staff? Any advice for how to approach my program about a raise?",academia,1639424149
76,What Phd should I go for?,"I hate to ask this, because everyone's PhD journey is different, based on their undergraduate degree, interests, fields, major etc. But I'm an aspiring teaching fellow, going to be a teacher for grades 7-12 in New York City public schools. As part of this adventure, I've also enrolled into their graduate level courses to obtain a master's degree at Fordham University, in their graduate school of education, for the class of 2024. I'm excited about this. I'm the second person in my immediate family to graduate with my bachelor's, and will be the first to graduate with my master's.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, however, I've been obsessed with the idea of obtaining and working towards a PhD. Initially, I was looking at edD's but I realize those are shorter, almost 4 years, and not funded, while PhD's are. 

  
I plan on going the master's route first, so I have extra credentials to apply, but I'll be 30 when I graduate from Fordham University and hopefully in a career opportunity, earning a salary at the Department of Education.   


Would it be smart then to continue to work towards a PhD? Almost everything I've read stated that I'd have to leave my cushy job, and live on a reduced income. I'm also single and haven't gotten a girlfriend, so that would reduce my living as well as opportunities to make a family. However, I've fallen in love with academia, and feel if I don't do this now, I won't ever have the time to do so.

Also, why didn't they get enough applicants? I'm suddenly suspicious of this college, and wondering what scared away all the other job seekers. do they know something I don't? Did the tenure line not get funded and this is their excuse?  
The answer is no, since I'm not interested in relocating to a new city for a 1 year position and the vague possibility of a tenure track position, but it pisses me off for some reason.

In my search for a list of closed access journals all I've been able to find is an old ResearchGate question where somebody requests a list of closed access journals in food science... and many many lists of open access journals.

Sure I understand that keeping research behind a paywall is not ideal but I'd argue that shifting the cost from the reader to the producer is not only not the solution but is in fact worse. It creates a ""pay to win"" environment where only those with sufficient funding can publish their work. It also creates conditions that facilitate predatory behavior where a senior colleague with funding can buy their way onto a paper or demand undue credit by acting as a financial gatekeeper. 

That said if anyone has been more successful than I in finding a list of closed access journals please let me know.",academia,1639230731

I feel confident in the application of theory to guide my analysis, but I don't feel confident about how it impacts the evidence I gather. For example, do I need to use scholarly literature that has also used the same theory for ideas? Or is this dependent on the theory and can sometimes be acceptable? 

What I have been thinking is it would be looking at the phenomenon through one lens and then another, so it might filter the observation too much. I also feel that some theories compliment each other, so it is possible that an idea derived using a derivative of legal theory could be used to explain an idea with a sociological theory.

He once sent us an email he doesn't expect us leave before 5 pm and come not after 9 am ( a 9 To 5 JoB aahhhhhhhh ) and you barely pay us this stupid stipend. Dude we stay at night and come on weekends you freak !

I don't even have time to myself, i barely come home cook take a shower and sleep that's it, sometimes i barely sleep 4 hours.
This Christmas he wants us to check on the lab every 48 hr like dude get a life.
Today the guy responsible for the waste cleaning asked me if you're coming this Christmas to the lab and he told me you guys ( our lab ) works a lot and he made a joke telling me to squeeze my PI by the neck
And I might do it because I'm losing it.

I can't go to the gym, can't volunteer,  can't go around the city, don't have time to just text a girlfriend online nor watch a dam serioes/movie.
I've been in montreal for 8 months and i never had time to go downtown , only once.
Can't even explore the city properly 

He texts me/email/call me at night weekends, sundays every dam time.
And gets pissed when you don't reply. And he then sends that email ""i want to see you in my office"" ubub ubb ub ub "" i don't know if you're a good fit""

Like dude seriously get a life.

He wanted me to register for work 10 hours per week  but i will be coming work full time, just so the university doesn't pay me benefits ""that i don't need"" and he told me whatever they ask you tell them you're only coming part time.

Oh and when he smiles and tell joke thinking he's funny i fake a smile and deep down he doesn't know how much I'm fanatising of burning down the whole lab. Thank goodness we are wearing masks so it is easier to fake a smile.

Like how the hell he got his PhD he gets lost and confused too much, doesn't know how to calculate molar weight, he thought by mixing 2 drugs that have same mechanism of action almost same structure 1 at 500um and other at 5um to have synergic effect, dude are you serious ?!

I've used our university library (which has widespread access to all the big guns -- PubMed, ProQuest, etc.), and I can't find anything for them -- but there is just no damn way this data doesn't exist lol. I refuse to believe the topic hasn't been studied and the numbers haven't been figured out.

**The student is doing a meta-analysis of PTSD treatments in adult populations -- specifically cost-effectiveness/cost-utility analysis using a unit of measurement as QALYs and USD ($).**

He has found plenty of sources giving QALY figures for EMDR, SSRIs, MDMA... But we cannot locate an article that has this same information for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy -- which is surprising. Like I said, there's no way in hell this has been figured out for no treatment and all these experimental treatments, but the gold standard (in combo with SSRIs) and most easily-accessed treatment for PTSD doesn't have any research. 

Do you have a preferred search engine or academic research database you prefer to search on? That has the best UI for suggesting related titles, or a great advanced search option?

We've found articles for youth, from UK authors, or sexually assaulted women -- nothing can really directly compare to what every other source measures (which is just PTSD treatments in American adults). We *could* use a UK-based study, but the fact that healthcare costs vary so much over there, it wouldn't really become a 1:1 comparison and would throw off his numbers.

However, my dream has always been to pursue math PhD, so I am starting to apply for graduate school. I have 2 choices: master or PhD. 

I am thinking to get a math master, get great GPA, and then apply for a PhD since it's going to be tough getting into PhD immediately.

59,my supervisor doesn't help at all and I'm trying to finish my thesis,"Hey everyone,

I know there are many people having this issue, and I'm neither the first nor the last one, and there isn't much solution to deal with this problem. I think I just need to share my problem, and maybe feel a bit supported. 

I was hired by an Institute as a master student, and at first I thought that there will be highly skilled people if I need to ask some questions. I am not a person who asks questions all the time, and need to research a lot before going to ask someone. However, after a couple of months of working in the institute, I've noticed that my supervisor doesn't know anything ( like really nothing in my topic) which can happen sometimes. He only directed me to some other guys here and I didn't even know them much. I got some appointments to ask but at the end of the day what I had was just a waste of time.

I lost my motivation, timeline, interest in this topic. I was going through a tough time due to some family problems, and he knew it. I never got any support about it as well. Whenever we had a meeting ( 30 min every 2-3  weeks) , he was only asking if I am going to finish soon. 

I'm feeling very alone, and having panic attacks sometimes. I have to finish this thesis in order to save my future. Because the country I'm coming from a 3rd class country, and there is no job opportunity or safety for women anymore. I have been carrying all these weights since I start my master. Writing this problem even makes me cry now, but I needed to get rid off it.

They pay me a student salary, and I feel guilty for not making a good progress in my topic because Iwas really all alone. 

I know it is a self disciplinary thing to start and finish your thesis, but if I knew this is going to happen I wouldn't like to be in an Institute where I'm being stressed due to their timeline. I rather prefer working in a coffee, and do an another thesis without the stress of 2nd person.

My friend told me to report my supervisor to a higher manager, and at least make them aware of this problem. According to her, this can cause a suicide of someone else ( getting no support, pushing towards a stress) 

Even if I report this is not going to solve my problem, and maybe will cause more problem for later. 

but at the end of the day I feel loser here, and I'm sure people who will read my thesis won't find me succesful. I was very dedicated to make a well prepared thesis, but I see myself failed .

I am worried that this will dampen my chances of getting a placement within the Master's Program I am planning to apply to.

The second paper has a paragraph at the end that says while they were making it, the other group published their paper (and made a brief comparison.  

However, it’s very obvious they ripped parts of the first group’s paper. First, the title is basically a carbon copy. Literally just changes the name of their tool (which is extremely similar anyway), changes “elevates” to “lifts”, and “new” to “next”. Other than that, exact same title. Second, the abstract was clearly copied. I put them side by side and highlighted sentences that were copied with words substituted for synonyms, or just rearranged. But they use specific wording several times that is beyond coincidence. Lastly, in the main text, they are more distinct but I have found several sentences that are just too similar to be a coincidence.

71,Am I crazy for shooting for John's Hopkins for a master's in biomedical engineering when I have a low GPA and ADHD?,"I've been dreaming of going to a good graduate school for my entire life, and I've known for a while that I want to study biomedical engineering. I got into this originally because I realized something was off with my mental health in late elementary school but I could never figure out what it was. I started reading a ton about mental illness and decided that I had some obscure form of depression or anxiety. The issue is, my parents didn't believe me because they've never really seen mental illness as a legitimate issue. That made me really mad, so I started to look into neuroscience instead of psychology in an attempt to prove that mental illness is real in a more concrete, non-soft-science kind of way. I've been reading books about this since middle school and that's led me down the medical imaging route, which I would need a biomedical or electrical engineering degree to practice. My life goal is to improve medical imaging to make mental illness more easily diagnosable and make diagnosis more accurate. (Ironically, even though studying mental illness has been my ""life-long hyperfocus,"" I never even seriously suspected ADHD was the primary issue until a few years ago and was only diagnosed a month ago)

I've been dreaming of going to John's Hopkins for grad school for a while, and everything besides my GPA looks pretty good. I started doing research on a bioinformatics lab as a freshman and am currently in the process of getting hired in an MRI Lab at a different university that has a very good reputation in the biomedical field. The issue is, my GPA is definitely on the low end of what they seem to accept and part of me is thinking about giving up. Right now I have a 3.29 as a sophomore but there's a very good chance I'll get a D in calculus this semester which will bring it down to around a 3.1. It's very frustrating because I know I'm a smart person and a lot of my friends are very surprised by how low my GPA is and by how poorly I do on tests. It's even somewhat common for me to act as an unofficial TA in some of my classes. I know I'm more than capable of understanding the concepts, but while I'm trying to cope with my ADHD and figuring out what medication is best for me, studying and time management is extremely difficult and it's making college much harder than high school.

75,"“Get support from at least two academic sources: one to whom you can be a mentee and one to whom you can be a ‘ventee.’ One will push you forward, and the other will hold you up.”","I was recently reminiscing with a colleague at a memorial for an academic mentor and friend who had sat on both of our committees.

During the conversation, which had evolved into a conversation about “academic pathfinding,” I offhandedly mentioned this quote, which our mentor had shared with me as a young grad student. To say I was surprised at how strongly they reacted to the idea would be an understatement. 

My colleague told me they had always been assigned or found someone who could understand them and genuinely say “I’ve been there too.” They recently got a new mentor-one who pushed them forward, and who gave clear, insightful, and highly strategic guidance about ways to navigate the blockages and “eccentricities” of the institution. 

In essence, my colleague came to the realisation that they had always gotten support and felt heard, but historically lacked someone who could push them through the work. The mix of both/and support and mentorship helped them have one of their most productive periods in their career. They found by happenstance what I had been coached to actively pursue and cultivate, and they were feeling the value and reaping the rewards. 

Given their response, I thought I would pay forward that advice I received with all of you, my anonymous online colleagues. 

I was told that both of these forms of support are necessary to navigate, survive, and maybe even thrive within academia. The hope of finding both in one person is both like finding a unicorn and asking a lot of someone, so I was encouraged to seek the two separately. I’ve consistently done this since, and I believe it as served me well. 

At each new school or in each new role, I’ve sought out and found someone who can help mentor me in the work, guide me in the role, or help me navigate the structures and politics of the institution AND someone to whom I can bring my stresses, concerns, and just general frustrations. 

Only once, have I found a person to whom being both at once seemed to come seamlessly; I have found many instances of someone being strong at one of those things or even at part of one of those things. Rarely has that person been my supervisor or direct/assigned/expected advisor. 

Similarly I think it is rare that I have effectively been both for another-though I do think I have, at times, been *each* of those things. 

I actively encourage students and colleagues to seek the other type of guidance (whichever one it feels like I’m not or cannot give in a particular situation). It helps me acknowledge what types of assistance I can give and the limits to that aid. Doing so also helps me feel like I’m not falling short on my obligations or desires to help them succeed-a real win/win now that I think about it. 

Anyway, maybe that some part of that rambling wall of text helps you or helps you to help another. I hope all of us find ways to have each type of support in our lives, and if we find ourselves someone who can do both, that we appreciate it to the very end. 

Thank you for reading this and for helping to keep alive a small piece of wisdom from my career-to-date’s only unicorn.",academia,1638442722

83,Publishing a dissertation on an open source journal?,"Hi there, does anyone here know if there are any journals where you can choose to publish your dissertation or piece of work open source? I am mainly looking to publish work I've done as part of a dissertation for which I have come up with all the research, performed the research and written up my dissertation all by myself. I literally had no help or guidance from anyone because my supervisor decided to not want to speak to me for the entire year I was trying to do my research (only time I spoke to her was at the beginning where she said I could work in a vague group). 

I was meant to work as part of a ""team"" but everyone ignored me and would make me work on stuff they needed for their own research and I was told to come up with my own ideas and do something on my own. So I painstakingly did this, I am not exaggerating when I say that I spent more than 14 hours in the lab for about 7 months non stop. I am truly not making this up one bit (I even complained about my supervisor not helping me but I was ignored). 

I received the top mark on my dissertation and all the sudden everyone wants to write a paper on my work and there's about 7 people who are on this paper. People are asking for my data, files and trying to do the exact same graphs from my dissertation themselves. I've tried discussing how this is my work but there is absolutely no way I can get through to them. I was even actively discouraged and was laughed at when I mentioned what ideas I had, some people told me it'd be too much work and I can't possibly do it. But I did it, and now everyone wants credit. 

I am so depressed and anxious because of this and honestly they keep bringing up this paper and copying my dissertation and pasting it into a paper format. I said I wanted to write the paper on my own and I was ignored for weeks until now everyone all the sudden is writing it. They said I can have first authorship shared with someone else - who had NEVER helped me or even talked to me, but apparently she's doing the same data analysis that I did on my data and that grants her equal authorship. 

I fell ill because of how hard I worked on this project and now it's being written in ways I do not agree with, people keep asking me what a certain analytical method is and method of analyzing the data is (this is a novel method that I spent weeks trying to figure out and adapt to my data, it involves a lot of mathematics and statistics which people have flat out told me they don't understand). I feel absolutely betrayed, when I begged people for help no one wanted to help me, I was laughed at and made to work on other things. Now because I got a good grade and my idea worked everyone wants to be a part of it. I am absolutely devastated, I tried to bring this up with people and I get ignored. There is absolutely nothing I can do, my supervisor is ignoring me and asking other ppl to ""help"" me publish the paper I have. 

As a result, I truly feel the only way I can get some ounce of ownership over my work is to publish my dissertation open source. I truly feel that my research is worth sharing with the world and I poured my heart and soul into something that has literally cost me so much of my mental health. Does anyone know anything about publishing in an open source journal? Would it cause problems if parts of my dissertation already shared will pop up in a published paper later down the line? There is absolutely no way I can talk shit about these people, one of them is a research assistant, others are research fellows etc. They have too big of a standing, everyone knows each other and are friends, I have tried to talk to people, get advice, but there is absolutely no way I can stop them from stealing my work and putting their name on it.

I absolutely loved science, but this experience has beaten me down so much that I will never go back to it.

I applied last year to PhD programs in the US and was unsuccessful, but I managed to get into a one year master's program in the UK which I am now in. I am currently preparing a new round of applications, and am noticing that many graduate schools will not allow you to apply to the school after three failed attempts. However, I'm in a situation where it is likely that this round will also fail, since my graduate program has only just begun and thus I will not look all that different on paper than I did last year. I was hoping to submit applications anyway in the hopes that something comes back and, if nothing does, to then reapply more concertedly next year once the master's is over.

However, if I do so, and those applications fail too (or fail to some of top choices), I've just realized that I will then not have the opportunity to apply as a visiting fellow down the road once I *am* in my PhD. Say I get into my second choice and fail in my first, for instance, but then down the road want to apply to be a visiting fellow back at my first choice. I will have then failed three times, and will not be allowed to re-submit. For my top choice, at least, they consider all applications to the respective graduate school, whether as student or fellow, to count towards this total.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and been unable to apply as a visiting fellow during their PhD program, due to failed attempts as a grad applicant?",academia,1638381203

Apologies if you've been seeing my name everywhere, I'm absolutely balls to the wall doing research on possible pathways. These past few days, I've been completely obsessed with the idea of garnering a phD or edD, especially the phD as I've heard they are paid for, whaaaaa? 

I'm an aspiring teacher, so my alternative certification program will subsidize heavily my first masters. Most likely, it'll be a masters of science in special education, adolescent history, grades 7 to 12, allowing me to teach as a generalist for high school students. 

From there, I'm looking to either increase my salary steps as a teacher by obtaining a secondary masters, +30 professional development credits, or obtaining a phD or edD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the question at hand, what are my chances of getting these degrees paid for? I make currently what the stipend living amount would be, and am super frugal, but as I'm not a STEM major, realize this may be super difficult.",academia,1638312097

96,Is it more financially rewarding to be a k-12 teacher or professor?,"I'm an aspiring teacher who is going to enroll in an alternate certification program that would train me, provide a living stipend, a teacher's salary, and a subsidized master's program. I'll be teaching in New York City public schools. However, having gone down this path, or about to start it, I got into the rabbit hole of ph.D's.

For all my life, I had been under the assumption that education is an investment and that it wouldn't be funded, you'd have to find the money, and therefore, it was a relic only established for those with money. I come from a family where we were dirt poor growing up, and I have fallen in love with teaching, or let's say, education as a field. I would not mind teaching college students at all.

Which field would be more financially stable? Being a professor would require a ph.D but it sounds like they'll fund it based on the program.

Plus, I hate to ask about money, but which career would provide a higher compensation?

97,Need ethics advice on helping a researcher as a freelancer,"So I recently finished my PhD and have plans for a postdoc that due to unforeseen circumstances got delayed by a few months. During this wait time, parallel to wrapping up my PhD projects, I decided to do freelancing to get to know what the industry requirements are and earn some money now that I don't get a paycheck.

I came across a project which to my understanding is posted by a postdoctoral student not well-versed in coding/working with data. He's an expert in his domain and wrote down the pseudocode for what needs to be done and the mathematical model of the process. He just can't do the coding and/or doesn't have time for it, that's why he posted the job on a freelance platform.

I'm quite experienced doing the type of tasks he posted, so I submitted a proposal and got the job offer. By the way, I found out about the client's academic background in the process of working with him.

So here's the ethical question that's bugging me. Should I be asking for some kind of acknowledgement from this person in his (potentially) upcoming publication? The domain is very far from what I work on, so asking for a co-authorship isn't an option, especially since I cannot vouch for the quality of his paper, but can only guarantee the quality of my work. Or should I instead ask to mention my name in the Acknowledgements section? What would be the ethical thing to do?

Having worked at the interface of theory and experiment, I know that it's a common practice to have university facilities do jobs for the research for money. And given the fact that this guy really knows the subject and will be writing the paper himself, I'm not worried of classical plagiarism issues.

Any input on this situation is much appreciated!",academia,1638299560

99,Incompletes and medical issues,"Hi all! 

I’m in a MS program and unexpectedly needed surgery on my arm. I have numerous issues with the arm and do have disability accommodations in place which gives me an extra week to do assignments. 

In this case, I’ve been unable to get the work done even with an extra week. I spoke with my advisor and professor. My options were to take a medical withdrawal or leave it up to the professor if she’d honor an incomplete. There are zero safe guards or promises that an incomplete would be honored. I attempted to work with the professor and ask if she’d be willing to give me until the last day of the semester to complete everything - she said no. I asked her about an incomplete and she told me “it’s too early to discuss this” meanwhile there’s a couple weeks left. 

I ultimately took the W as I had no confidence she’d give an incomplete. 

Is this the “norm” for all universities? I’m quite shocked this is how unexpected medical issues are viewed and ultimately treated.",academia,1638289780

2,How do I begin personal research?,"I'm a gap year student (due to personal reasons), who graduated high school May of this year. When I was applying to colleges last year, I didn't really have a clear idea of what direction I wanted to go, just a bunch of ideas and things I'd like to do. I didn't go into this gap year looking to figure that out so much as I just wanted to do the things I enjoy doing. 

As it so happens, it feels like every little mundane thing I've done, read, or seen these last couple of months has led me to a very specific niche subject of interest. I want to explore human perception of the universe through interdisciplinary research in both the arts/humanities, as well as the sciences. 

I don't necessarily want to get anything out of this research other than self-satisfaction and a greater understanding of myself, but obviously, I'm way out of my league and would really appreciate any advice. Where should I start? (I've already unknowingly been reading articles and papers from NCBI and found some that are super in line with what I'm looking for.) 

I don't mind the time commitment either, because, again, I'm doing this just because I'm interested in it. If I reach out to professors, should I be honest and tell them this is what I'm interested in and just want to learn more?

4,Bf's dad is pushing me to start real 'working',"Here is the story: I have finished my PhD 2 months ago from one of the  top universities in Europe. Currently finishing to publish my second first author paper in a really good journal. I was quite depressed when I just finished my PhD but starting to feel better and gathering the labs where I want to do my post doc. I talked with quite a few professors and they all are urging me to apply for post doc because they believe I can make a good scientist. That was also my dream since I have been in high school and I worked really hard to get where I am now (doing lots of lab work since high school, working on side to pay for the best education I can get as my parents couldn't support me and etc.). It's been tough 11 years without breaks and long holidays and my plan was to take 4 months off as I can afford to do that now.
Unfortunately! I had lunch with my boyfriends parents and his dad started attacking me by telling that I should stop doing 'bla bla' and start working in the companies because they pay much better and I should start getting payed better. He even called his friend who works in a company and made me to talk  with him in front of the whole family. And that guy was also in his 60s big money maker that told me that I will have to focus on my family soon as I am getting older now and I should try to earn a lot now.
I have never asked anything from that family. I always came bringing nice souvenirs, I pay my half rent/food/vacations even my bf earns more than me. I think I manage to be very well financially independent.
But I am so angry now with all of this. I know that it's none of their business and it was highly inappropriate from his family to push me like this. I have never imagined that I will have to deal with this kind of money focused narrowmindness and it really makes me sad.

A little background about me, I am a second year dental student, and that is why i chose to tutor in biology specifically, because i have quite a decent understanding of this topic especially questions that are high yielding etc, bc i have taken over at least 100 biology exams in my academic career. So that is why i chose to tutor biology as opposed to chemistry/orgo, because i definitely understand biology a lot better. 

What should I do personally as a tutor. Should I have them bring a copy of the curriculum/syllabus?Past exams from professors? Do i just read over the textbook chapter with them and study with them, or do i only help them in a certain point that they are having a hard time comprehending? 

I really want to succeed in this pursuit because i really enjoy teaching and explaining things (love doing this when i study with others and help them out) and i would really like to be successful in helping other students overcome subjects that are difficult for them.

27,UK Masters Engineering degrees are actually bachelors degrees," My purpose for posting this is only to raise awareness and start dialog about this issue.

I did my bachelors (BEng) in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. It was a 4 year undergraduate degree with an option to do it in 5 years due to the low pass rate (around 25% of the class actually passes in 4 years). The degree is internationally accredited by the Washing Accord.

I moved the the UK right after studying and started a career in engineering. I notice that all of my colleagues has masters levels degrees (MEng) which they did in 4 years. This immediately raised red flags for me as it would take 6 years at minimum to get an MEng degree in South Africa and most other nations that are signatory's of the washing accord.

So I did a bit of digging and after looking at many course structures at red brick UK universities I noticed that:

1. The MEng UK degrees have less subjects than a South African BEng
2. The South African BEng has a broader subject range - as a mechanical engineer we did subjects in electronic, structural, material sciences and chemical disciplines as well as 2 years of mathematics taught by the maths department (not elementary maths taught by engineers) and also introductory courses in programming.
3. Core mechanical subjects such as thermodynamics have deeper learning outcomes in the South African degree than the UK (Bath uni was used for comparison)
4. Some UK Mechanical Degrees don't have Dynamics courses outside of basic physics.
5. Mechanical Engineering gradates who worked under me could not solve basic thermodynamic questions I gave them relating to the HVAC industry (these were Bath, ULC and Kings College graduates)
6. Both the UK and SA degrees end with a year long research project (dissertation) and design project.
7. The Washington accord objectively accredits international bachelor degrees to the same education level as UK ""Masters""

So I know what you are about to say - but UK degrees are very difficult and students need to work exceptionally harder etc etc. I have not seen factual evidence of this, given the fewer number of subject and going less in depth, it seems improbable. I had friends with A\*A\*A\* grades at A levels who did not manage to pass in 4 years during my course. On top of this we had an exchange program with MIT (pretty much the highest ranked engineering uni on earth), to which I have proof that the South African exchange student out performed their MIT class 4 years in a row. (a new 3rd year group each year). I believe Oxford was part of the same exchange program.

So the question then is why does the UK get away with labelling 4 year undergrad degrees as ""Masters""?

After doing some research I found this:

""**Firstly the BEng course used to be 4 years in order to cover the content for a professional engineer. However there was pressure to get it down to 3 years to match other bachelor degrees. This was partly to reduce costs to the government and partly because students were voting with their feet for shorter easier courses. When one university pared it down to 3, then others soon followed, since they are in competition. It was probably OK, because employers expected to invest in a considerable degree of training. (They have since become more reluctant and expect more of the university.)**""

There you have it, the UK rebranded their bachelor degrees to masters overnight due to political and monetary issues. NOT exceptional academic performance or otherwise.

Why is this important?

It discredits students from outside of the UK such as the EU, USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, SA, India etc who have objectively worked harder and learnt more in obtain masters degrees by placing UK undergraduate students unfairly at the same education level on paper, given UK students an unjust advantage on their CVs.",academia,1638096061

A recent published paper from a group I know is published, I look at it and while reading some parts are really written very poorly and not homogeneously and many mathematical equations that has nothing to do with the paper and citing tons of their research and one collaborator. I dont know if anyone has encountered a paper receive praise from certain members as a propaganda and while looking in detail the abstract, introduction, some figures with good quality, others really bad described and drawn. I dont want to underestimate maybe they put effort in doing that, my what makes me upset recognizing it as a good work although we know there is nothing was novel and just promoting. Another pet Peeve I found several papers coping the introduction with slight changes, there is no real effort to write a real story about the paper or respecting the reader mind. I identify myself as not a good writer but recently I fall in love with writing when I am really passionate about what I am doing, but here neither the case is exist and I wonder if I should do something about it or just be silent, I found that not really helpful for progressing the field in general.

Background on the situation: I finished my PhD in February, subsequently moved back to my hometown, and had been in talks with a professor at a university in my hometown to do a post-doc. Here's the kicker - I waited 7 months for the uni to get their crap together and send me the letter of offer for the post-doc. That finally arrived in October, yes last month, and as of this week I have a job offer for an AMAZING career in industry with a start-up company (which pays over 2x the current post doc!!).

My issue? I have too much of a guilty conscious and I have NO idea how to approach this situation with my post-doc advisor. I did make it clear from the beginning that I was 50/50 about being in academia/industry, and that I was constantly applying to industry jobs (if you've gone through this process, you know it can take months or years to make the jump!).

The students have weekly quizzes, weekly discussion boards, three five-page papers, and a final exam with multiple choice and short answers. We discussed they would take on the discussions, do the quizzes, and split the writing assignments. 

I got sick several times this term and was behind on a writing assignment. They said it was fine multiple times and not to worry about it. The second writing assignment came up, and they asked me to grade 55, and they would grade the first five, so I have an idea of what the grades should be. We previously agreed to 50/50, but I felt terrible for being behind, so I understood. 

I waited for her to grade five (I hadn't gotten rubrics before, so I'm freeballing a lot of this), and they didn't grade them. I checked every day for a week and didn't see her grade them, so I figured I would grade them today. Well, they graded two quizzes and the entire writing assignment over the weekend.

I feel shitty about this because I know they are stressed AF and only took on more work to do this. They didn't tell me they would do this and I feel terrible. It seems passive-aggressive to me, and I don't know what to do.

Thing is, when we spoke, the prospect of professorship was unclear. I have experience in industry, but it adds up to maybe 2 years. The voice at the back of my head is telling me that it makes more sense to first jump back into industry for a few years, to rack up experience , rather than continuing in academia. The logic - it may be quite hard to take a prof. On civil engineering seriously without strong industrial experience. Also, after 3 years, i think it may be way harder to jump back into industry if I choose to. Whereas it may be easier to jump back into industry with 3 years of industrial experience....

Our group consists of 5 PhD students and 5 master's students. During the 2.5 years I've been here, our research group has published a total of 3 conference papers. 1 of those papers was mine, published after I went on strike over the summer and worked on nothing but research.

Despite our lack of publications our group has been working hard... on unpublishable contract work for the DoD and major companies. During my master's I regularly pulled 100-hour weeks and juggled multiple sponsor meetings a week, to the point where I did not feel like I had a chance to work on my master's thesis. I wrote up a bad 18-page thesis the week it was due, after finishing some deliverables for a deadline.

Do you think I'm likely to get a response, and are there ways I can increase the chances of success? If not, are there other routes that I could take to get involved in research part-time?

Here's my sales pitch: 

* *I have a record of producing publishable research*. Although I dropped out of a PhD program previously, I've published 2 papers and written a third. (I also rediscovered a few results from 20 years ago... oops.)
* *I won't need much training*. I took all the graduate courses covering the CS fundamentals on the qual exam. For specific research topics, I've self-studied from online lectures to the point where I can read recent papers.
* *I'm super motivated*. I self-studied those many hours of lectures and read a bunch of research papers just to send this email.
* *No funding required.* (Thanks, industry job.) 

Essentially, I'm volunteering to help solve problems simply because I really enjoy thinking about stuff.

I am a 5-th year PhD student in a US University in the field of computer algorithms and optimization. My PhD funding will stop in some months from now (by the middle of 2022), and I am about 2/3 rd way into my dissertation as on this date.

I received a job offer from a company that wanted me to work as a research scientist in my area that pays well, and they would like me to join very soon. They didn't seem particularly interested about whether I had a PhD or not at the time of joining since other employees in similar roles in this company do not have a PhD.

When I told my advisor about this, he told me that me leaving at this point would practically be the end of my PhD program, as he would not be able to make it convenient for him to work with me on the rest of my dissertation if I joined the company.

What do *I* think about it? I've been working on algorithms of various kinds for my dissertation during my PhD, and I like this kind of work. However, an infuriating thing about academia is the extent to which you need to satisfy a reviewer's/advisors whims and fancies. Papers that I send to conferences/publications are rejected because they want something more. Projects that I am working on need constant revision because my advisor always wants more results. At the rate I am going, I am not sure if I will be able complete my PhD successfully before my funding ends.

This has made me disillusioned with academia, and I really want to start something new with my life instead of beating up old horses (my dissertation projects) hoping to squeeze out more results. Industry roles in my field seem a lot more forgiving than academia, and they pay really well.

But I also hear from my colleagues and friends that I might as well stay a few more months and complete the PhD after trying harder, given how long I have been in the program.

I would like to know from you these:

1. What are your views on my situation?
2. If I am not interested in academia any more, and only want to make my future in the industry, is having a PhD on my resume worth it?
3. How can I talk about an incomplete PhD on my resume? I am at an ABD stage. Would this impact future job prospects, or will my job experience help me out later on?

I always get completely stressed out with deadline and anxiety makes it worse. It debilitates me and clouds my intelligence or creativity. And I ALWAYS get in horrible situations. Always making up excuses for more time and missing deadlines etc... It completely wears you out...

What bothers me I have a very aggressive and hostile PI yelling, screaming, I already submitted the same extended abstract ti see whether it fit their scope (higher impact factor). The PI refused, yelled and forced to to consider the next journal since they are very challenging as reviewers blah blah.

I dont know what I should do, this PI affected my mental health and physical, so hard to communicate with, very aggressive and always put me down.

I  am fed up and I dont have options to switch, find another, academia for me has been the same almost not good apples rarely to find any good apples.

I dont how to bring this to him and not yelling at me for reason and no reason, should I sent a third email to the editor or wait again.",academia,1637310691

Right now I'm working, the environment is generally good and the work is satisfying (bit boring), but I wanted to do a PhD.

As at the end of October he told me that everything was solved, but I still did not have any type of contract or acceptance letter. I was asking if it was possible to send me the terms under which I would be employed (that is, salary, vacation days,etc). It took them more than two weeks to reply to my emails and more than three weeks to send me such a paper in Dutch (I am a foreigner, I have always communicated with them in English) and when they gave it to me, the start date of the contract was November 15 and I receive this the 16th.

2,Job Hunt Advice - Ph.D. Film/Communications - U.S.,"Hi, everyone. Posted this in r/AskAcademia, but thought I'd ask here, too.  Hope that's not a faux pas (these are my first Reddit posts).

This is my first year on the job market in academia and I'm trying to gauge how worried I need to be, what I need to expect in the coming years, and compare my situation to everyone else's. I've lurked on this subreddit and other ones related to academia, watched YouTube videos, read statistics, and been told by faculty about how abysmally competitive and broken the hiring process has become. Maybe foolishly, I've still waded into its waters this year. To my eyes, it has not been going well, but that's why I'm curious to hear others' thoughts on my experience so far in relation to their's.

Background:

\-I completed my Ph.D. in Communication-Film (how it's listed on the transcript) in August 2021.

\-While finishing my dissertation this year, I was intermittently applying for positions, all of which resulted in automated rejections or radio silence. Since graduating my sole ""job"" has been applying to academic openings at a variety of institutions. I have applied for TT jobs at research, liberal arts, and other institutions along with full-time and adjunct pools at community colleges. I have applied all across the United States and a few overseas openings.

\-My application materials have been looked over by former faculty advisors and peers. They all seem to agree these documents are strong.

\-I have two published chapters in scholarly collections, a handful of conference presentations, and have taught undergraduate courses for six years (a combination of intro-level assigned classes and senior seminars that I have proposed and had approved). I know my CV is weaker in terms of published work that others, but I have been told that is not out of the ordinary at this stage. Though I am applying for both research and teaching positions, my dream situation would be to fill a full-time teaching-centric role at a community college or small liberal arts institute; I am far more passionate about teaching than research.

\-**Here's the major question:** Acknowledging that the 50+ applications I have completed are largely within the current hiring cycle (openings that begin in Summer or Fall of 2022), should I be worried that I have not been offered a single interview or response other than rejection emails?

I read other posts about people who have submitted a similar number of applications who are also not finding work, but are at least getting interviews or some kind of reaction. What really scares me is that none of the adjunct pools I have applied to resulted in anything; maybe ignorantly I thought I could fall back on those while continuing to send off for full-time jobs. When I finished my Ph.D. program, I moved out of my apartment (couldn't afford it) and am currently living with some friends. But that goodwill can only last so long and I'm terrified by the prospect of not having a job when they need me to leave. I read that some people on here are on the market for two or three years before nabbing anything. I would be grateful for advice from anyone who is/has been in this same position or has experience on hiring committees.",academia,1637264782

8,Timeline for IRB approval,"Hey all, I'm going forward and conducting a pilot study  to test the efficacy of an orthotic device. After speaking to my uni's IRB board, it seems that my project will fall in the ""minimal risk"" category, however, I'm not sure about this. I was told that an expedited review would take about 2 weeks to go through, but this is contingent on the device being ""minimal risk"". 

So, how can I determine if my device is minimal risk? According to the [formal definition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4703320/), my device may not be minimal risk because there is a chance of blood flow occlusion (I have taken several measures to ensure that this does not happen). However, a technique that is applied by my device is also used in other areas of medicine. So if some basic ""proof"" and a few papers supporting the fact that my intervention is safe are out there, then could it definitively be classified as minimal risk? 

In your experiences, how long does expedited IRB approval (for minimal risk) and convened IRB approval (for greater than minimal risk) take?

When I enrolled at my school my financial advisor told me as long as I submitted my fafsa form prior to enrolling, and listed them as a school on the form, they would receive the form and I’d be good to go. Which I had already done before hand and already been accepted for financial aid as an independent. 

Then I went and selected my refund option, and it says they haven’t received a refund yet to deposit. Which is fine, lol. Cause school hasn’t started. 

But then I went to the fafsa website to make sure, and when I check my financial aid summary it says they can’t find any records of me ever receiving a federal pill grant or anything. 

I’m just worried now because was there something else I was supposed to do? I don’t plan on taking out any loans just yet. I’m only using state funded grants I will not have to repay later.

I already have a long list of schools that I'm really excited about, so I don't want to spend the extra time applying to this institution to make her happy. As this PI is not writing one of my recommendation letters (I already have three from more recent employers/PIs), she would not be able to see which schools I'm applying to. She really doesn't take well to people telling her ""no,"" and she is also very well-connected at her and other institutions, so I would like to avoid angering her by pretending that I applied but did not get in.

15,Conflict between advisor and lab mates,"I'm a postdoc working at a research institution and have recently been witnessing a conflict between my advisor and my lab mates, which has ended badly and resulted in several people leaving the lab. Even though I was not initially involved in the conflict, I have recently had to take several steps of action to help resolving it. I'm now questioning whether I took the right course of action here and am looking for feedback.

The rough course of events went as follows: there was a conflict several months ago that escalated quickly, of which the exact details are not known to me. This is because I have a slightly detached position as a computational person shared with another group and did not sit in this (wet) lab every day. In any case, it escalated quickly with group members filing complaints first to the institute leadership, and then to an even higher governing body. In the end, some agreement was reached and several group members were put into different research groups at the same institute. As a result, basically nobody remained in this lab except two students who both graduated not long after all of this, and this was the situation for several months until a technician came back from a prolonged absence. 

In this whole period I tried to not get involved in any of this and still continue my work as far as I could. I also kept contact with both sides involved in the conflict and tried to keep good relations with everyone. Recently, with the dust seemingly settled, I decided to spend more in my advisor's lab (with the technician also back), also to try to help out as far as I could.

Meanwhile there was still a student who was almost finished and therefore not placed in another group, who was doing badly and probably suffered mentally. Because the student and my PI were not allowed to communicate directly, everything went through a third party and the whole situation stressed out my advisor considerably. There was also an evaluation coming up (my advisor does not have tenure yet) where they would decide whether to punish my advisor and whether to extend my advisor's contract. So my advisor asked me for support, and I agreed to write a letter to the institute management (team of directors) in support of my advisor.

Thus, I wrote a long letter to the directors in which I carefully explained my view of the whole situation. Even though many details of the conflicts were hidden from me, I have been witnessing the events from the side and felt that I could provide useful information and a more detached perspective that would help them in making important decisions. Nevertheless, after some careful thought, I chose to strongly support my advisor on this issue as I could in the end not make sense of the actions from those who left the lab.

My letter was well-received by the management team, my advisor got a warning without any punishment and their contract got extended. Everything seemed to have worked out well, at least briefly.

By taking these steps and siding with my advisor, I felt that I had no choice but to break with the former lab mates who were against my advisor. This was very hard as they were not only lab mates but also my friends, and the only coworkers I regularly interacted with outside of work (my other group is not that social). Since I never had any problems with them, and we still run into each other in the institute and at various occasions, this has created some awkward situations.

I felt that I had to keep distance from them, as there was no way I would still be credible to my advisor and the leaders if I would hang around with them, have lunch, and so on as if nothing happened. So I decided to be frank and texted one of them, who has been a great friend until now. Basically I said that I had absolutely no problems with them on a personal level, but I thought we should no longer hang out together at the institute. It felt almost like breaking up with someone, and I got some muted response back. 

On the one hand, I also felt like I had no other choice. It was either my advisor and career, or my friends, and I chose the former. But I'm also still doubting whether I made the right decisions at every step. Was I too eager to support my advisor on this by writing a very supportive letter, and should I have kept a more neutral position? Should I not have sent that text to my former lab mate, and pretended that nothing had happened (after all, they might not know about the letter)? Maybe I would not had to distance myself from my former lab mates this way and I could have remained friends, but I can hardly imagine remaining  neutral for a long time after all this happened.

The whole situation has been dreadful for everyone directly and indirectly involved, and it seems like everyone lost in the end and nobody gained anything. The lab is in a shitty state, I'm lonely, my work has been delayed, but I'm still trying to make the best of it and hope there will be better times coming.

I've done my best to recount the main events of this complicated situation without revealing anything confidential. Many thanks if you read it all the way till here, and I would really appreciate your feedback.",academia,1637187015

20,Finishing my MA thesis or not?,"Hi all, 

I used to be passionate about all things research. I am in a super great MA program at a top university, with great professors and courses. I did 8 out of 9 courses for the program with a 4.0 gpa. 

The problem is, I've been depressed (and in therapy) for over a year. Its a miracle i've been able to keep up with my courses, but my thesis work has really suffered. The other problem is that through all this therapy, I understood my current program is really not my path. I don't really want to work in this field, and in fact I have found my calling in another (more practice-focussed) program, with very little to do with my current program. 

I thought that since I could not start my new program until next september, I should finish my MA in the meantime. But honestly I am just feeling so miserable all the time, and it is hard to justify spending another 8 months in this mood, while I could be much happier doing something else, especially considering I don't want to work in my field. 

Another part of me thinks I should still finish because it would be great learning to do a thesis, those skills are never lost and my desired program is not research based, so it is my opportunity to write a MA thesis. Also my thesis topic is interesting to me even if I am not motivated. Also, I'm scared of getting out of the perfect academic path I've been trying to trace for myself.

In her edits, she wrote a paragraph of interpretations of my data that she solely came up with. She asked me to just accept the edits, then review it so I can defend the material.

It didn't sit right with me, because the edits had nothing to do with the motivation or conclusions of the chapter. They were totally peripheral, and cited another grad student's paper. Her writing suited the conclusions of their study, not mine. I felt that when my reviewers would have read it, they would have said that it was jarring and out of place.

So I said no, providing the rational above. She is dissapointed and confused, but we handed it my thesis anyway.

I am somewhat new to reading research in any systematic sense. I started to use Mendeley to keep tracking of papers and generally speaking I like it. Organizing papers and making highlights is great.

The problem I am having is having some organization across papers. Mendeley seems great but its functionality seems to be mostly for each individual paper.

For example I have paper 1, paper 2, and paper 3. I need to keep track of claim A that appears in those 3 papers. I need to organize different paragraphs/references of that claim across the papers.

The only way I found was to make a ""notebook"", where you can make notes from highlights of different papers, but I don't like the layout and it often bugs out, causing the link to the highlight to disappear and only pure text remaining.

I also can't seem to find a search function. I would need to either 

- Search all the highlights of all the papers I have
- Search the highlights of specific papers (for example a specific folder or tag)
- Search any text (highlighted or not) of all the papers I have´
- Search any text (highlighted or not) within specific papers. 

From what I can tell, Mendeley offers none of them. What do you all use to solve this problem?",academia,1637058095

35,My major program is a scam. What can I do?,"TLDR: I attend a major public research institution with over 50k students. My major program is a complete scam and I want to know what I can do to prevent other students from falling prey to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 4th year senior pursuing a B.A. in UX Design. The program is run by a director with an academic background in writing/English. They have no relevant experience in the field. In fact, they have done nothing but teach English prior to starting the UX program, according to their resume. This lack of experience shows.

&amp;#x200B;

The majority of core classes are writing courses. If you're not familiar with UX, it has nothing to do with writing. In addition to the writing courses, there are a few graphic design courses sprinkled in, along with an intro and capstone, which the director teaches. Since interning with a few companies, I've come to realize just how bad the program is. I've had to learn absolutely everything on the job, and am no better off because of my courses. The core principles of UX are not discussed in any depth, probably because the program lacks instructors with relevant experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of curiosity, I checked in on all the graduates of the program from the past year (about 24 students—it's a small program). Based on LinkedIn profiles, less than 30% of grads have a job in the UX field. Of those, none work for tech companies. Only 2 work for companies with at least a regional presence. Consider that UX is one of the fastest-growing fields in the world right now (8% per year!)

&amp;#x200B;

An internship with a tech company was recently pushed out to our email list, and many students applied. I happened to know the recruiter, who told me that the applicants from our major simply could not compete. Not a single one was interviewed.

&amp;#x200B;

I've already tried giving feedback to the program's director—they were defensive and only pretended to care. What can I do? I've already been screwed, but I don't want others to. I don't think it's ethical for this program to exist.",academia,1637017559

38,Theoretical contribution before qualitative fieldwork done ?!,"Hello 👋, so I'm a PhD candidate doing qualitative research combining traditional ethnographic methods and newish participatory action research methods. I haven't done my fieldwork yet, which will take place in India, due to the pandemic and therefore I have no data yet. My research topic has not been explored much and there's nothing about it that was ever done with the population I will study. My research is rooted in Community Psychology and I'm using some of the theories in that field to frame my whole research. Now, the main objective of my research is to deepen our understanding of those concepts as conceptualized by said population through their own experiences. 

Here's my issue : my advisor keeps asking me to present what will be my theoretical contributions to the field of Community Psychology. I've told him numerous times that I can't predict what those will be since I haven't collected any data yet.

Am I crazy for thinking that what he is asking at this point doesn't make sense with me having no data at all yet ??? 

How am I supposed to come up with theoretical contributions with no idea of what I might unearth during my fieldwork ?

Any help, suggestion, advice will be greatly appreciated. I just don't know which arguments to give him anymore. And maybe I'm wrong and he's right ?! Sooo confused.

Help lol ! 

NOTE: My advisor is a psychologist and he's dead set on psychometrics and stats and the whole quanti thing. I don't think he's ever done anything quali or been the advisor to a student whose dissertation is using a qualitative approach.

I am a second year mechanical engineering student. I am planning to contact and work with professors for research in the summer of 2022. However I do have some concern.

I am a very creative person who would like to work with and design new schematics for models and not just be a cog in the machine. I am very goal oriented and live in the mind.

Other than that, I would like to know is the R and D as impactful as it is in other companies? Or is it more boring and useless?

I  attempt to answer but it usually falls short, I make sure to say ""I want to learn"" but it's not good enough. 2. My own language betrays me despite efforts to sound ""professional"" e.g. I might inadvertently say ""kind of"" or use the wrong verbs like ""want"" instead of ""will"" which indicates a lack of confidence. 3. connecting psychologically with other academics.

I told my honors supervisor this a couple months ago, and I asked him to write me a LOR. He agreed, and he encouraged me to apply for Masters funding. 

Here’s the issue: part of the application requires a research proposal. This is a problem given that I don’t have a supervisor for my Masters yet. This is because the school I’m applying to has to accept you into the program first, then they pair you with a supervisor (i.e. you don’t necessarily get to choose). As a result, I don’t know what my project/research question is, nor how to carry out the methods. I also went to an information session for the grant, and most of the people there were already in their Masters, so writing a proposal is much easier for them when they already know what they’re doing.

The application is due in two weeks. I haven’t even begun working on it for the reasons above, and because I have a pretty heavy semester.

For context I am a resident physician, did a comprehensive literature review in a niche and understudied area of my field that's gained a lot more interest/awareness over the last few years. I believe the quality of my work is pretty solid and comparable to other narrative reviews I've seen on Hindawi for example.

Since we can only submit to one journal at a time as we await the decision, how do I know how to choose between say Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience,  Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, Behavioral Neurology, Psychiatry Journal, World Psychiatry \[plus any other larger general Psych journals\], and The Journal of Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences (this last one seems like the best fit but again not sure how to figure out my 'odds' based off Impact Factor or H index stats and such..)

55,Concerns over advisor/supervisor,"Has anyone had the experience of an advisor/(potential) supervisor pushing their research agenda in your thesis or dissertation?

I booked a meeting with my advisor to share a leap in logic I had recently made for my Master's thesis, and essentially trying to gauge its relevance (based on their expertise) and a timeframe I would need for the demographic/sample size I had in mind.

Essentially, they recommended I look at a different topic as ""people are already researching this"". My impression is that a master's thesis is about learning how to do research, and replicating a study to confirm/strengthen the argument or contributing to growing knowledge on a topic is a good objective for such a short project.

When I mentioned my participants in mind, they mentioned concerns over consent and told me to sample the students parents (survey/tools would be done in a high school). I understand consent can be tricky with younger groups, but that's where I think the valuable information could lie for this specific issue.

When I mentioned that a shortage in a profession may be linked to students not continuing their education due to lack of interest in a certain field, they said it shouldn't. I then replied but the question I'm looking at is ""is it?"", not should it.

I inquired about doing an independent study with a professor from another university (we have a program that exists between universities in the province) who has written some work from a critical lens on this topic, and the advisor requested their name, and dismissed them as somebody who is irrelevant in this field.

What I discovered is that they(advisor) seem to have advised ministers on setting up the current framework, and it almost feels like the advisor/(potentially) supervisor does not think this framework should be critiqued or researched. Every suggestion feels like it would strengthen their position in relation to this topic.

I have contacted my faculty and requested a change, the only issue is that the original advisor that was assigned to me is the only ""expert"" in my particular scope, so I'm kind of hoping I can make a very broad connection with another faculty member.

I don't want to be unprofessional or bar my chances at being taken seriously as an emerging scholar, but I also don't want to spend my foundational years as a scholar researching things I don't find interesting, or developing a jaded view of academia and the procedures within.

If anything, it was nice to share this experience, but would appreciate some potential next steps from anyone that has experienced this as well!",academia,1636813265
56,"What should I do to a professor’s super racist, sexist, and ageist private talk?","I’m a PhD student and I used to hang out with my advisor a lot. So the other day she took me to a restaurant and we met another professor of our department. We’re all Chinese speakers, so he probably got too comfortable with us and let out a huge lot of really disturbing talks that are very uncomfortable for me. 

He talked about selecting future PhD students and he used very rude words for people from South Asian countries. Accusing them that they won’t work hard and blabla (which is definitely offensive for me for I have a lot of friends from these countries). And it’s also very ridiculous because my advisor had just told him that she’s been working with an Indian professor. We were very uncomfortable hearing that. 

Then he said that female students over 27yo (he referred to female in a very disrespectful way too) are not okay because they’re “unstable”. Both my advisor and I are female and I fall within his “unstable age range”. And he just threw those words to us. 

Also he acted very hostile in a Uyghur restaurant that we had to leave without ordering, just in case he would cause any drama. 

I really don’t know what I should do. To be honest, during the whole lunch I felt very stressful to hear all these things.

There are numerous complaints against him though. We don’t have a Chair anymore. I’ve been told by members in the Department that my program will not exist in a year and my cohort is the last one. I also saw a leaked email about our Department being disbanded. I tweet about the toxicity of academia, alt ac positions, and feeling like I’m working towards something that’s failing right under me. Everything is so hush hush. One faculty member (I don’t know who) saw my tweets and sent them in a group text and it was the topic of the department meeting this week. My advisor, who has recently stepped down from a few positions, asked me what was going on. When I told them everything and what all the talk was, they denied it all. No real proof. No explanations. They just said it wasn’t true and I needed to focus on the good. Every time I bring up the power dynamics between graduate students and TT faculty, I’m forced to be silent or they throw some type of distraction my way. I’ve felt some tension recently. I know the faculty in my program are I uncomfortable with me because I’m starting to become vocal, when I’ve always been the quiet, nice girl. I’ve been at this university for nearly 5 years. I had to delete my tweets because they were “harming the department.” But I was speaking the truth. I ended up apologizing to a few members, but I’ve honestly felt sucked right back into being the obedient dog with a muzzle over my mouth. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for. Advice? Insight? What does this sound like to someone on the outside of my university? I’ve thought about dropping out for a long time, but I genuinely enjoy my research and I’m just getting started on my dissertation.",academia,1636673521

82,"am I paranoid, or is anyone else noticing that there could be a 'modern' underlying (cold war?) ""conflict of the faculties"" taking place between philosophy and psychology ?"," I am thinking of articles like the one posted recently, how ""philosophy could be making you depressed"" in comparison to Zizek's critique of the ""new"" APA guidelines.

I am also thinking about how Zen/karmic/self-help psychological-philosophies fit neatly into this capitalist cost-benefit analysis when it comes to our interpersonal relationships, compared to ""the philosopher's"" ' \*almost endless\* capability to, lets say, 'absorb conflict' / or give the benefit of the doubt to even the wildest assertions... or even a step forward than that, this kantian ethic of treating others as ends in themselves.

I saw a post on /r/ science where Psychologists are saying that DEplatforming people is good for societal collective mental health... another post about how being a devil's advocate is actually a form of ""toxicity"" ..... whereas the strategy of the philosophers, on the other hand, is to give the side you disagree with as much benefit of the doubt as possible before you show that they are ultimately wrong in their assertions.... Philosophers are always open to playing with dangerous ideas, and are more likely to defend an agora-like public sphere.... meanwhile, psychologists tell us to cut these people/world views that ""do not serve us"" out from our lives. (side note: do all my ideas have to *serve* me?)

For the Hegelian philosopher, Conflict is a ritualistic offering to the possibility of actualizing a public good. For the American psychological association, you need to manage your emotions efficiently so that you can mentally survive/thrive.

PS: side but related question: is my belief in socialism a psychological ""limiting narrative"" when it comes to my relationship with making *more* profits / exploiting surplus labor in our capitalist system?

PPS: In Witches, Terrorists, and the Biopolitics of the Camp (2018), Cynthia Barounis explains how an ‘aective turn’ perhaps asks us to supplement “our paranoid models with reparative ones” (217) before concluding that “Sometimes what looks like paranoia may simply be a matter of having learned to see what is right in front of you” (235).

\------

of course, in both disciplines there are disagreements... and they are both not monoliths.

if your opinion is that there is conflict within the faculties, and that they shouldn't be viewed as monoliths, then shouldn't it be pretty obvious that there would be external conflict too?

for example, i didn't want to get into the stupid divide between continental/analytic or positivist/critical theory philosophy.... hegelians vs spinozists...

but im asking if you can at least, for moment, recognize that ""a major portion of philosophy"" has ""major beef"" with, if not ""a major portion"" but rather the ""authorities"" of psychology (the american psychological association)

\*\*of course i am biased here as psychologists seem to be a bit more monolithic in that they have massive ""accreditation""/institutionalization issues. \*\*

while psychologists who disagree with the APA are subject to this ""cut off"" and DEplatforming issue as well...

interestingly enough, it is the cont. philosophers (zizek's frenemies?) who are more critical of free speech in the public space.... while i would assume that most utilitarians and positivists would defend ""the agora""

for psychologists, what happens in the ""agora"" is bad for our mental health; this is why need foucault here, talking about the neoliberal subjectivity (i would call this colonialism) that motivates this line of thinking",academia,1636611024
83,Just accepted an industry job. Not sure how to feel.,"Just venting, really - to the only people who probably understand what this is like!

So I've been exploring non-academic positions for next year. Not sure if this will be a permanent transition or just a temporary one... but today I got an offer for an analytics position and I accepted it. I'm not even sure how to feel. I'm scared that I'll regret it one day, but there are no academic positions where I live and at the moment I'm not wanting to move overseas just for my career (COVID, family and my community are close, etc).

I'll still be doing a bit of research with the lab I did my PhD in, since I'll be staying here. So I'll hopefully still be able to publish 1-2 papers a year, in case I decide to go back to academia one day.

My mind is just swirling with questions. Will I like this industry job? Or will I miss ""getting to do what I want"" as an academic? Will this tank my academic career? Or maybe I'll decide not to return to academia at all. Am I making a mistake? But what other option do I have? Am I going to fail at this because I only have experience in academia? Ahhhhhh!

86,Renege postdoc offer because of cancer?,"I know reneging is super frowned upon but I have a weird situation that I need advice on...

**I signed a postdoc offer** from a reputable national lab which would require me to move out of state. I was excited for it!

**Then I got diagnosed with cancer a couple weeks later.**

I'm currently a patient at one of the top cancer centers, which is in my current city. My family is also here, and they've been an amazing support network. So **I want to stay in my current city** until the cancer is treated and surveillance is less frequent (doctors estimate 1-2 years).

I told my postdoc manager, and he said **the postdoc is not a work from home position**, but he'll contact higher ups to see if that's a possibility.

So I started looking for other opportunities and **I got an industry scientist offer in my current city**.

The industry job pays significantly more than the postdoc and the research is still aligned with my goals.

**Then my postdoc manager came back and said work from home would be fine.**

I don't know how I feel about working from home, however, because I really value face-to-face contact and teamwork.

**I don't know if missing out on face-to-face contact will be bad for my career (I would be the only person at the national lab working from home). I would feel like that ""missing sick guy"" who no one actually gets to know.**

I'm therefore thinking about reneging my signed postdoc offer to go for the industry job...

I know it's frowned upon, but I need more money (I've learned insurance doesn't always cover everything) and I don't feel comfortable being the only person at the national lab who is working from home.

I want to tell my postdoc manager that long-term I want to be at the national lab (which is definitely true), but right now I want to work in my city and develop professional contacts face-to-face.

I don't know how this will be handled... **Will I ruin my image at this national lab? Will my reputation be tainted?**

I feel so bad about even thinking about this... But at the same time I know it's the best decision for me.

**TL;DR:** Accepted postdoc position at a national lab, got cancer, they offered to make it work from home, but now I want to work in my current city.",academia,1636578018

Despite not getting funding, they are extremely detailed and basically a recipe for resubmission and success. Very high marks and reviewers reached out nudging me to change a bit and resubmit.

Upon receiving the reviews, my dept head is desperate to see them, but is locked out. I do not want to share them. I do not trust this person and had a terrible time going through the institutional process to submit. The dept head has no experience in my field, has no NSF grant success, and is interim. They unreasonably criticized an early draft I shared with trust, provided no useful feedback, and spread malicious gossip about my proposal leading up to submission. Later the dept head inserted themselves as co-PI on other junior faculty’s grants and made things bad, supposedly a strategy to secure their interim position and earmark funding for themselves.

Now that the reviews are back and the proposal got very high marks and suggestions to improve it, the dept head is trying to get involved gain.

4,Trouble moving from non-tenure track to tenure-track at an academic medical school,"Hoping for some thoughts on this. For context,, I got my first faculty position two years ago at an academic medical school. I was hired into a clinically oriented department as a researcher, with the idea that I would start the process of bringing more research activities into the department. I got a startup with 3 years of salary support with the expectation that I'll support myself on soft money (at least 50% salary coverage) after that period. The position is non-tenure track assistant Professor, but I was explicitly told that this NTT status could be temporary and I could move to TT. They said all new research-oriented faculty are hired as NTT and the successful ones move to TT. 

By most accounts my first two years have been very successful. I've published quite a bit, and I've now funded 95% of my salary on federal grants. The department literally only pays 5% of my salary. It also looks as if I will get my first R01 grant, as PI, within the year. I also do a good amount of education. I teach one class for 1st year med students and I chair a summer seminar series for PhD students, as well as mentoring med student research and serving on several dissertation committees. 

I've now broached the question with my department chair about moving to TT. She said she agrees that my work is above par and checks all the boxes, but she said she doesn't think it would necessarily be good for me to move to TT. She went on that in her opinion there's nothing wrong with staying on the NTT. My position is that I think I deserve a valued, long-term position, which ultimately tenure reflects. I realize that tenure doesn't mean too much at Medical schools, but it does reflect commitment and the TT has higher salary. I brought this up with other research faculty in other departments and they strongly agree.

My chair said we could revisit the issue in a year or 2, and I just think I'm being bushed. I don't necessarily want it now, but she could at least lay out a roadmap for this. After all, our tenure clock is 10 years and that wouldn't start until I move to TT. Wondering if I should push harder for this. I haven't asked for anything and given my accomplishments this seems fair. After all, I could always leave and bring my grants with me, and their investment would have been for nothing.",academia,1636378170

12,A thoughtful pedagogy that includes both empiricism and critical theory: is it possible?,"I am curious if anyone could help me understand how this debate between ""theory vs facts"" has become so contentious and if, at all, there's a way to find a middle ground that incorporates both concepts and literature. 

I guess I should start off by saying what brought me to want to ask a Reddit thread about this. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in media/cultural studies and am also a professor. I love what I study and find it so interesting however whenever I visit my father he makes it clear that he is not a fan of what I ""do"". Over the course of the past 6 years or so my father has become increasingly more conservative (he went from a sort of left-leaning ""classic"" University of Chicago alumn intellectual who loves Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy to being a regular patron of the Joe Rogan show). When I ask him what his political affiliation is he says he is not left or right but an ""empiricist"" and believes that postmodern theory has taken over academia and has left ""real hard FACTS"" to die. I think he particularly has been incredibly turned off by the concept of people being ""genderqueer"" or ""transgender"" (the idea that someone can just PICK their gender) (this is particularly interesting as I am trans myself but that's not important). This morning I asked him if, in his opinion, there is any room for critical theory in his ideal world of academia? And he said that yes but only if it is taught side by side by empiricists such as Thomas Sowell... but that the academy doesn't do that...all you read are Marxists.  Admittedly this got me frustrated but I also just don't even know what to say to this. In my mind, we DO need to be critical of where ""facts"" become ""facts"" and just the mere notion of what is considered truth or ""real""... but at the same time, I also see how that line of critical thinking has maybe gone out of hand?   


Is this just *such* a political topic that there isn't a middle ground to all this? I realize that I would have a very difficult time being in a room with a professor or researcher who claims that to be ""trans"" isn't ""real"" as you can't scientifically change their gender. Or ...I believe that white supremacy is a structural and institutional issue and I could also see myself not wanting to see someone present on their data that shows that structural racism isn't real. Is this the problem then? That I am not willing to even humor those thoughts let alone teach them?

&amp;#x200B;

What are people's thoughts? Are there any authors I should read that address this issue? That talk about WHY critical theory should be taught and how to make it less politically divisive? Or how we could perhaps include more ""conservative"" writings and teachings without .... teaching things that are full-on prejudiced and bigoted? (apologies for conflating far-right conservatism with prejudice for anyone on this thread who wants to respond to this who identifies as far-right- if anything I'd like to hear your thoughts too)

21,Supervisor stalking My Social Media And Hate To See me shining,"Hello,

Before joining the lab I am in I used to do a lot of activities which happened to give great opportunities, recently I have been invited by a prestigious university to be one of the main speakers and giving me a nice gift I never received through my career. I was invited behalf on my activities, nothing about my institution, or our research, it is mainly about these scicomm activities. I posted on my social media thanking them for the gift. I received from my supervisor angry message that they will replace me and find someone else because I didnot tell them and I must tell them. I replied that this was an invitation on behalf of activities and nothing about research we do.

Mind you with they always yelling, humiliating, angry and I feel they are so much jealous of me because these activities gave me access to many people in the field which they are bothered with. Even my journal paper was welcomed to be submitted to very high impact journal and they dismissed and were angry that I shouldnot submit there and consider a lower impact journal.

Overall, I am really tired, I am working hard, people in my field know I have a very good reputation, I started my career as academician, and due to life events and mental health I was delayed and they view as a newbie and shouldnot receive all these recognition.

When I started they were to stop from these activities since I am receiving all the access and recognition. In the mean time, I am always professional and they never stop pressurizing me, undermining me, and they want to replace me because I got that prize on behalf on something beyond what I am doing with them.

23,A long reflection of my graduate experience.,"After 4y, I’m wrapping up an Msc in an experimental field. My scientific contributions are minimal, but I’d like to share my reflections nonetheless. Perhaps there are others who are or have been in similar situations. If so, maybe this will help. 

I feel that my situation is simultaneously very good and very bad. Let’s start with the good. My advisors have been generous and patient enough to keep me on payroll. I’ve received external funding once and an internal award twice. I’ve also TA’d, so my finances are alright. I’ve made lifelong friends in my cohort with whom I’ve shared both my darkest hours and my successes. I’ve learned so much beyond the science - what I want for myself, how to communicate effectively, etc. 

Now with the bad. This is very long, and may have nothing of value. As you all may have guessed, 4y is just way too long for an Msc.

At first, it seemed to be a simple case of technical issues that I would manage to troubleshoot, given time. But, I couldn’t. Experiments didn’t work because XYZ, and when these were resolved, other complications would arise, etc.  We had senior members of our lab initially, but they left for various reasons before I felt comfortable being independent. There was one other lab that works in a  similar field, and I could go to them for advice. 

Weeks turned into months, and a year had passed before I got to where I could finally think about doing my intended experiments. I had spent my first year learning the basics, but knew almost nothing about the methods I would be using. The available documentation was unhelpful, as the body of technical literature was abbreviated, steeped in theory, or outdated. Recently, however, I have found extremely useful resources that I wish I had encountered earlier. 

Thus, when things went wrong, I was often helpless due to my general lack of knowledge. My unintelligent efforts aside, some of these problems were resolved with advice from a former lab manager, and of course, Twitter. My experiments would work, literally, &lt;5% of the time. I was afraid to ‘waste’ resources on large optimizations, but would regrettably spend much time doing so. In a poorly funded lab, and perhaps as a product of my upbringing, I was reluctant to prioritize time efficiency over the lab finances. 

Throughout this time, I was learning and improving my programming skills to analyze my data. Unlike my lab work, programming gave me a sense of fulfillment, satisfying a need for self-affirmation. Coding helped me regain confidence in my ability to learn and achieve things, however meagre. 

As 2019 progressed, the coronavirus pandemic magnified the negative emotional impact of my fruitless toil in the lab. During lockdown, I spent my time on different code projects, most of which were left unfinished. I was busy, but not productive. After restrictions were raised, however, my lab experience only worsened. I would go into lab, not interact with anybody for weeks, achieve nothing, and go home feeling defeated. Sometimes, I would succeed and feel elated, but with nobody around to share my thoughts, good or bad, I felt, and eventually became, totally isolated - physically, socially, and emotionally. After a penultimate committee meeting, I decided to follow my advisors’ advice to just write my thesis. 

This brings us to today. Having underestimated the writing process, I became preoccupied with analyses and reading. After nearly four months, I’ve finally managed to produce a draft. 

My final reflection, a regret, is that my self-dissatisfaction and poor self-esteem, at least early on, made me neglect basic human conduct. At the peak of my frustration and stress, I would find faults in trivial things, and behave terribly, both towards others and self-destructively. Though my behaviour seemed quirky at best to some, I can’t help but feel ashamed at how different of a person I was then. 

If I were to extract a non-technical takeaway for my past self or new students to learn form, I would tell them to reach out to someone early on. For me, there were people who I knew would be able and willing to help, but I rarely approached them. I simply didn’t have the courage to overcome my shame and self-doubt, and above all, I feared disclosing my inability. But, we grow only through experience. Not only as scientists, but also as people. I’m prepared to tackle things differently in the future, and doing so will be the hardest thing I’ve ever done.

I would be glad if this helped you in any way, whether it be through becoming a foil, or resonating with some personal experience. Thanks for reading, and best of luck to everyone in their studies and work.",academia,1636145438

I'm extremely glad to share my Himalayan Doom Folk debut album ""भराड़ी घाट / Bharari Ghat"" - 

*Bandcamp:
[भराड़ी घाट / Bharari Ghat](https://harulvinay.bandcamp.com/album/bharari-ghat)

Instagram: @menelvegor 

The album comprises of eight songs, out of which two are Ulver and Whoredom Rife covers. 
Some specific Western Himalayan influences as far as the song structure, instrumentation, lyrics and themes have been incorporated. The music and the story I'm forming, needles to say, is heavily influenced by the works of Tolkien (hence the post here!). 

The nearly extinct Takri script of our region has been used for some of the write-ups.
With this, some serious field-work was done and the full repertoire of the Pahari Baja (Himalayan Ensemble) of the Kotgarh village was recorded properly for the first time in human history (credits: Himalayan Folk Collective) for archiving purposes in order to retain our slowly vanishing cultures and traditions. These very earthy recordings have made their way to the album as well. 

""भराड़ी घाट"" portrays a burning and smoky vision of hell, and touches on themes such as environmental, cultural, floral and faunal degradation in our locality. 

The album is released via Old Mill Productions of Canada (@oldmillproductions) on Deluxe edition CDs (including an expansive 16-page booklet), with a limited edition cassette tape version (sold out) from Frozen Woods Records of Italy (@frozenwoodsrecords). 

... 

A lot of hard work and dedication has gone into making this album. What you listen now is a result of nearly a full year of work and dedication from not just myself, but also from a lot of people, locally and internationally. I truly hope you enjoy listening to it. 

Thank you so much for your time!

I'd like your opinion on students writing up their thesis for publication in academic journals. 

I am thinking of doing this, because (1) I would like to share my work with the scientific community, (2) a publication would benefit my supervisors.

Recently I have been thinking about how my project can be mutually beneficial for my supervisors, and I figured (a) if the supervisor chooses the question, (b) if I produce a publication, or if my supervisor can use my research output.

Multiple times I have offered to work on the specific question that my supervisors are interested in, but they tend to say essentially, it's my project and the specific question ought to be one that I am interested in. So, I cannot offer value that way.

How would you feel if a grad student wrote up their thesis as a paper and offered to add you as a co-author, and offered to let you edit, and input into the choice of journal?

Would you regard this as time-saving and helpful, or would you rather write any paper yourself?

45,My supervisor for my bachelor thesis is making me unsure in my project (Biomedical Sciences),"HI! I'm currently doing my final year of Biomedical sciences. I picked a project that had the topic of 'observing the activity of microbes in food', and I was given the title 'Isolating bacteria from fermented food and determining their antimicrobial activity' 

Basically I just isolate bacteria from probiotic yogurts and see how effective they are against commonly known pathogens.

 I had a meeting with my supervisor to discuss my project. Part of the project is to also give a justification in why you're doing it, and I asked if it would be okay to mention gut diseases since it relates to my topic. He was very taken a back and made me feel unsure as to why I mentioned that, and said that I was straying too far from my given title. He made me feel so unsure about my own project. I guess it was the way he carried himself? saying things like 'oh, why don't  you tell me why you're doing that'. He has a phd in food science so I thought he'd know? 

I asked why not, and told him that probiotic yogurts have been reported to help with the natural balance of gut flora and therefore relating this project to gut diseases linked  to the imbalance of bacteria in the gut would be a good idea to justify for the project. 

It'll be in two weeks when we submit our project plan essay for this  and he'll refuse anyone with a draft right now. I don't know why. From the start it seems we didn't communicate very well. For example, I asked to do a Kirby baur disk diffusion method, which would help visualize the inhibition zones for antimicrobial activity, but he told me no and said it's not as easy as I would think? He didn't give me a reason. I just think it's the way he approaches things and it makes me lose confidence and creativity in my project (I never wanted to do probiotic yogurts in the first place, he just told me to do it.). I feel like I can't say no because he's the expert and I'm the one learning. I've spoken to other people who have been assigned to him and they feel the same way.

Reviewer 1: praised framing, methods, analytic plan, had a few minor things they'd like to see.

Reviewer 2: said framing was off-base and should be changed, said method was unclear, said analytic plan didn't fit, recommended major R&amp;R.

I've been in academia for a while but have never had such polarized reviews. My question is: should I reach out to the editor to inquire what they would like to see? Something like a brief summary of the reviews and then my plan to address A, B, C, but not X, Y, Z; with a question of if they would find this acceptable?

Or should I just work on the R&amp;R, politely justify to Reviewer 2 why I chose my framing and analytic plan and not change those things, add a sentence or so of clarification about the methods, and then cross my fingers at the resubmit?

\[Note for more context: this is for a special issue.

My school is a mediocre school. The reason why I decided to take the master program is only because my mom died the last year when I was studying my bachelor degree. I had no idea about what is a master program, just want to hang out with the same friends. And I didn't care about making money. My topics are gender and class base on Pierre Bourdieu's theory for analyzing the book of Edouard Louis. The problem is i don't have any related studies, my school only teaches French language, no literature at all. and I haven't progressed for months, and all the credits of class I've already finished. I think with my bachelor degree in French, I don't have too much choice for finding a job. But I'm not sure if my degree with take me far as well. The only advantage of me is I speak Mandarin (mother tongue), English and French. But I have zero working experience. I'm really doubting if I can finish my thesis and I don't want to waste more time.  Because I have no Idea what how to write it. Just basic idea without the knowledge of how to put it together.

I've done all the work, alone, for months, with my own means and with barely any help. I've had to do everything. My director and a colleague are helping me write the final paper to send for publication. They are included as authors and I don't mind because they're helping me out. Also the guy who provided the data is included as an author, ok by me. 

Now, there are three guys who I've never heard of and know nothing about, who have had absolutely no input in anything and are also listed as authors. They are very relevant in their fields, but... 

Is this normal? Can I say something? Or should I say something?

75,Undergrad lab intern with an authorship problem,"Hi, so I've taken time off from (chem major) college to work as an intern full time at a national lab, and by the time I go back to school, I'll have spent 7 months here on the same project. I'm also applying to grad apps, so this experience matters to me.

Originally, I was going to be 2nd author on the paper for this project, because my postdoc mentor is 1st, and he gives me directions (intellectual contribution) and I do every experiment independently at this point. My experiments tackle the main goals of the project, and I've taken a lot of ownership in suggesting ideas. This is the only thing I've worked on since I came here. It took a bit to settle in, but according to my mentor, I was able to work independently very quickly.

2 months after I arrived, a new postdoc came, and started some side exploration experiments for this project, working part time with his other tasks. I was told it's likely I'll get bumped down in authorship because he needs it more for his career.

I'm internally upset with this. For the first 3 months he was here, he did not contribute any data to this project, his reactions kept failing since he was stubborn to adjust to a new lab. My postdoc mentor offered suggestions, but the new postdoc is always defensive. Now, 4 months in, he is finally getting some experiments with other metals to work (I'm using one catalyst, he's been making some others that he thinks will work, they only partially work). He regularly tells me he hates being here, would rather go home, spends lots of time on his phone, and wants to enter a new field other than chemistry after this postdoc....

Should I talk to my PI, or just give up? I have 2 months left here. I could slow down and work at his pace, never going over 40 hrs a week (that's all I'm paid for, but sometimes, just to get faster results, I've put in extra time on weekends, I'm not in school so I have the time...)

Lastlt, I don't want to be given the advice that my contributions are paltry just because I'm an undergrad. My postdoc mentor agrees with me that this sucks, but he tells me to wait for now, until everything is written up. Well now I'm kind of anxious.",academia,1635814644

They are both very competitive and I will know the outcome of my applications in late spring/early summer of 2022 (To start in Sep of 2022).

Now, an academic in my network that knows that I am looking for opportunities just informed me that a prof. that he knows (Good university/research group) has an open postdoc position and to make a long story short, I was offered a position in his group. The project is interesting, the salary is OK, and I can start as soon as I am done with my PhD (March), but no later than May of 2022. 

This means that if I accept, I will have to commit to that project and withdraw my applications for the two fellowships.

I worked as an RA all throughout my undergrad and got to know a few professors and graduate students reasonably well, but I didn’t have much of a peak behind the curtain into the politics of science until now. Over the past few months, I’ve come to realize just how much the personality, quirks and flaws of an individual chair, advisor, graduate student, etc. can affect the research experience as a whole. Some professors in the department as absolute nightmares to work with (mine is not exactly a walk in the park), some chairs are apathetic, and some graduate students are completely neurotic. Obviously, everyone has their own thing that makes them tick and their own work style, but I didn’t expect other people’s personality to color my own experience so much. I think a large part of it is just my own naïveté about the “adult world”; I guess I expected adults with esteemed jobs to completely check their emotions at the door and act as professionally as possible at all times, which is obviously a little unreasonable. But I think another aspect is that people in the field of academia tie their intrinsic self worth to their work. A bad day at work, or god forbid a failed project, means YOU are a failure. This creates very high personal stakes at the workplace, and can sometimes bring out the worst in people.  I have seen a lot more tension, gossiping, and even tears in the first few months of this job than I would have guessed (not from just my lab specifically, but in the department as a whole).

87,Worried about entering grad school when I can only write well last-minute,"I am an undergraduate student applying to M.A. programs in the humanities (not elaborating since my field's quite specific) with hopes of eventually entering a Ph.D. 

All of my best papers during my undergraduate career have been written at the very last minute (hours before the deadline). Most of these papers have been written for my advisor, who is a notoriously harsh grader but has never given me anything below an A-- until I stopped procrastinating. 

Since I know that my style of writing papers isn't sustainable for grad school or an academic career, I've put a lot of work into breaking my procrastination habits. Since starting to write things ahead of time, however, I've routinely received worse feedback and lower grades from my advisor. The best example of this is an abstract I submitted recently. She told me that the quality of the abstract was so low that she could only hope I'd written it in five minutes. She was very concerned when I sheepishly told her it had taken me five hours.

I've discussed the issue with her and we agree that it's probably because I'm overthinking things, but she couldn't offer any advice. It's been incredibly frustrating trying to cultivate healthy habits and getting punished for it (I'm not blaming my advisor here, only myself). The whole situation has made me question if I'm even cut out for a career in academia, because shouldn't your writing improve the more time you put in? How can I succeed when I'm experiencing the opposite?

My question is, how do I learn to work ahead while achieving the same quality as my last-minute work? Has anyone else struggled with the same problem? If I can't find the answer before getting to grad school, I'm not going to last for very long.",academia,1635712564

This is the situation:

 I've been an English language teacher for the last 12 years. I was good at it and am eager for education to be part of my life in the future. I feel I'd be mad to not use the skills I developed there. 

I've also discovered that data science is utterly fascinating. I'm really enjoying the material we are looking at. The workload is heavy but manageable. I don't doubt that I am capable of completing a PhD. A career involving research and teaching in some capacity would be very rewarding to me.

\- I'm 37. I feel that trying to enter into this academic field in my mid 40s is a risk. 

\-I worry that financially I would be mad not to enter the workforce after my masters as  academic renumeration will never be as competitive as what I could earn otherwise.

7,Pursuing a PhD later in life,"Hi all, how difficult is applying to a PhD program after working for a long time? 

I (over 23 years old) once started a PhD in CS at a top-tier university, but despite acing coursework and publishing a paper, I eventually dropped out due to lack of motivation / research direction. Since then, I've been working in industry and learning math in my free time, hoping to find interesting problems and return to scientific pursuits. However, I am increasingly concerned about the application process. I haven't chatted with my previous advisors in years, so getting recommendation letters seems difficult, and I worry that my previous record may leave a bad impression. Since I am afraid to apply until I've decided on a concrete research agenda (one that I understand in immense detail, and will definitely motivate me), I may wait several more years, and by that time, I'm not sure anyone will even consider my application. Is there some way I can remedy this situation, or am I just being completely unrealistic?",academia,1635398733

I am a second year postdoc in social science. Since i started my postdoc training after the pandemic, i havent had a lot of chance to interact with other postdocs, so wondering how others are feeling. 

As i moved on to my second-year postdoc training, i feel a bit more nervous and anxious. Am i on a right track? Will i be a competent candidate in a job market by the cycle of 2023-2024? I am also somewhat confused about my postdoc position and expectations. Currently, i am doing my postdoc at an institute different from the one from which i graduated. I am definitely not as inexperienced as most of doctoral students as i completed my doctoral defense and published my doctoral dissertation papers. However, i am not a faculty, either. 

I work like a dog lately to publish papers, but i am afraid if what i am doing would not be enough to get a faculty job in a couple of years. Even if i manage to get a faculty job, would i be this busy for the rest of my life? This lifestyle is not sustainable and i will die from being burnt out.. Then, do i wanna move onto industry? I still like doing research, tho. While i am resting, these thoughts have been haunting me.

Unfortunately, i do not have any close postdoc friends. I have my partner who is willing to be all ears whenever i complain, but he cannot understand everything i am sharing as he is in a different field. I just wanted to vent my frustrations like this before i explode. Btw, I am a foreigner, so please excuse my english.",academia,1635374613

Is it possible for people to retroactively get transcripts corrected for a medical reason or can someone still get a Master's from a different program even if they flunk out of a PhD program?

I'm not quite ready to start a Master's program yet but I'm doing way better than I was. I'd probably have to do something part-time or online.

I sometimes think about reaching out to the professors from that program and apologizing and thanking them for their faith in me but I was dealing with undiagnosed bipolar disorder.

I should be studying for an exam right now, but I kinda feel discouraged today and thus I'd like to hear your thoughts about this (I'm probably not the first to ask this question...)

I'm in grad school and I'm doing just fine. I have generally no problem understanding the content of my lectures, sometimes it takes some time for me to fully grasp the concepts but I feel like I am a bit above average.

What I'm worried about is what will happen after I finish my MSc. I would LOVE to be a PhD student and then become a researcher. I feel like studying is what fuels my life. However, I see how competitive this world is, and my impression is that if you're not one of the best ones it will be virtually impossible to succeed and have a normal career in academia (I don't dream of achieving a Nobel prize, being able to do some research, write papers and maybe become a professor would enough for me).

I was in the top 10% of my undergraduate degree and now I think I'm in the top 30% of my MSc program, more or less. So I'm clearly not the best, and the higher I go in academic qualifications the smarter the people I encounter. Is the passion for what I study enough? Or will I succumb to the mountain of peer pressure, competitiveness and lack of research funds of institutions?

30,Helping others without getting acknowledged,"I am a PhD candidate from a US university and my research is predominantly in biosciences. I am in the advanced stages of my PhD and I have gained experience in certain experimental and theoretical techniques which are not easily transferrable. As a result, I often get approached by people who are interested in using the experimental technique which has resulted in successful collaborations with other labs and they have always offered to make a a co-author on their papers. My experience of working with people from other labs has been great so far. 

However, story has been a bit different when it comes to collaborating with the people from my own lab. I have helped people design some experiments, discuss the theoretical aspects, devoted time doing experiments and also teaching them how to do those experiments to some extent so that they can be self sufficient to some degree while I focus on my own research. But for the last two such instances, I haven’t got any credit for it (not even in the acknowledgment sections of their papers). Now I have been again approached for help with the same experiments a third time and I am wondering how should I approach the situation so that I do not end up devoting too much time on something that might not lead to any returns, especially during the crucial tail end of my PhD. I wanted to get the opinion of the community on the following questions:

1) Are these “goodwill gestures” common in academic life and, should I just take it easy and be a good team player, not worrying about returns?

2) Should I be forward and approach my advisor? Would it make me look like not being collaborative enough (potentially risking future collaborations with my own advisor and others)

3) Should I just avoid collaborating with them, since they have not acknowledged me previously in their work? And if so, how should I say no to them.

47,Asked to edit a new scholarly handbook. What should I expect?,"Hey fellow academics,

I was recently asked if I would consider being a co-editor for a new anthology/handbook on my area of expertise. The publisher is a fairly well-known imprint of a giant in academic publishing.

I'm a newly tenured person, so I feel pretty happy and honored, but I'm also an academic, so I'm naturally a little skeptical.

I'm wondering what I should be asking before going into this venture. I generally know how this process works, since I've been a contributor to edited volumes, though not with this publisher.

First thing that I'm wondering about is royalties. I know that authors don't get anything, but what about editors?

Second, for those who've done it, what's the workload like? I'm talking about post-proposal, since I still need to write up a proposal and get some contributors. It seems like writing an intro, maybe some peer reviewing, and the normal herding of cats that is any venture with other academics. Am I missing anything?

Third, related to workload, I have a fair amount of research assistance that comes with my new tenured position, what things could I have that person do? Am I responsible for indexing and whatnot?

Fourth, I'm an interdisciplinary person, and I'm little worried about the balance of my publications, especially since I was hoping to pitch a monograph in the next 12-18 months. I work in two fields, call them A and B. A lot of my work is at the intersection of A and B, but I have some stuff that's purely A and unrelated to B and vice versa. I'm starting to worry though that I'm mostly known for A. In terms of conference and colloquium invitations, peer review requests, and now this edited volume request, people really see me as an emerging figure in A. I also used to have a joint-tenure-track position in A and B, but I've moved to a new school, and I only teach A. Despite all this, I was going to pitch a monograph in B and something unrelated to A. Will taking on this handbook move me too far into A?

57,Fear of Publication,"I'm actually an undergrad student working on a publication for an undergraduate journal and have been dealing with massive anxiety about it. It is getting published in a few days and I'm feeling sick (almost to the point of throwing up) that people won't like it, will think it sounds, that it's riddled with typos, that I somehow misrepresented the sources I cited, and that somehow I'll get accused of plagiarism even though I never copied anything from my sources. Publication feels so permanent and scary. I'm scared of my thoughts being out there for people to see and for my writing to be tied to my name and for it to come up anytime anyone searches for me on Google. I know this is just an undergrad journal after all, but I'm seeking advice from y'all on here because you must be used to publishing all the time.... after all, it's part of your career. Is it normal to feel not so happy before publication? Not feel relieved, but rather, feel this sense of embarrassment almost about your work? Feeling like when people read it, they'll be able to tell what an idiot you are, or that they'll try to refute your arguments? How do you all deal with this?

62,"2 years of research potentially down the drain, just need some uplifting words","Hey everyone,  


I'm a last year PhD student who probably has been having the worst few days of his adult life.  


As (large) part of my PhD research I solved a difficult mathematical problem that I encountered during my research. The problem was motivated by its applications in physics, and I published papers on it. It passed peer review and my advisor signed off on it and it was considered a pretty impressive feat. This was supposed to make up a large part of my thesis.    


In the past couple of days I was finishing off some details and out of a sudden realized that it is highly likely (90% sure) that the physical systems this new solution allows to solve could be unphysical. Although the math is interesting and correct, it is starting to appear that my entire motivation for solving it and the reasons why the solution is relevant and interesting are wrong.  


I will keep researching this but I'm feeling completely worthless and like a fraud.

63,"I am 17 years old, how do I complete high school in 1 year?","Until I was 15 years old (end of middle school) my life was pretty normal.

Since I was kid I was smart, grade 1-6 I was a ""excellence student"", it's a diploma in my country for those with an average of 4.5/5, I didn't study much or tried hard, I didn't even was attentive in class, I was always in my world but the day before tests I would resume everything and do well. 

Of couse after grade 6 resuming everything the day before wouldn't work so my average was 3.6/5 until grade 9, end of middle school.

Now that I am finnaly in high school I thought to myself that I would finally study and focus because now my average would be important to acomplish my dream of joining a good university in Asia.

When I was in grade 7 I decided that I would study a lot and study abroad the whole Univeristy years (Computer science) in Asia. Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Macau or Hong Kong. Why study abroad? Because I want the experience, I love meeting new people and new cultures. Why in Asia? Because I wanted a whole different culture (I live in Portugal, Europe). Why these countries? Because they have an amazing culture and are good economically and they are countries that I can see that they think in the future, and thats very important if I want live there in the future.

End of middle school this is when everything starts. I will resume a lot because I dont wanna say what were the personal problems and its so big. In the end of middle school I started having a lot of personal problems with my family etc and even my mother decided to move me to other school in other city where I knew no one because I wasn't attentive in classes on my other school.

I went to the other school and started high school, it was a school in the middle of nowhere and I hated it, I didn't adapt, I couldn't study because of the personal problems with my family, my grades were super bad  and with everything happening at the same time I got a depression and my mental health wasa very bad, after half of first year of high school my mom finally decided to move me back to my old school but again a class that I knew no one, coming after half a year with a depression, bad grades and personal problems. My grades were still bad and I didn't want to live more, I was in the dark hole seeing my dream fading away. Thats when the whole COVID thing starts and online classes are a thing now, it helped a lot to my mental health but it would be impossible to improve grades because of online school but I passed. My first year ends with bad grades and a decent mental health. The summer was decent, I had no personal problems and I was just trying to recover from my depression. My second year of high school starts with normal school, I had no motivation, my high school grades average was already ruined by my first year, but I tried, I tried studying, I tried being attentive in classes but I just wanted to stay in a dark room sleeping, my grades weren't improving, my dream was fading away, personal problems with my family were growing I was going deep, instead of recovering, I started missing school and after half a year of second year of high school I stopped going to school, I went to psychologists to help me and to justify not going to school but it didn't help, I failed second year of high school and I need to repeat it again. I lost a year in my life.

The summer started my relationship with my family improved a lot, my personal problems ended, I recovered from my depression and my mental health is good again, I started working on myself, working out, reading, taking the driving license etc. School started a month ago, I would be in my last year of high school but I am in my second year of high school with youger people that judge me or not, I don't know because I didn't go to school one day, a month after school started I am here typing this to post on reddit, I am motivated, I have a dream to study abroad next year but I can't because I can't go to school, if I go to school I need to do more 2 years and I won't be able to attend to university because of my grades average. 

Thats why I am writing this, what should I do? Coming back to normal school isn't a option and my psychologist agree. I have some options like studying in home and takes tests in school and exams etc but I didn't want to waste a whole year! I want to go to university next year like my friends! I will take the cambridge test to have a good diplome of english language, I am thinking about doing a programming curse while I am in home etc.

70,"Just another one of those ""I'm leaving academia"" posts","Just venting, so feel free to ignore.

Am currently on a fixed term contract which will end in February. And I think I've decided to leave academia. The constant chasing of grants, publications, research projects... although I really enjoy research, I've never liked the idea of feeling like I was reduced to how much money I could bring in or how many papers I could publish. So, I've decided to leave (I think) - helped along by the fact that there aren't very many jobs anyway. I feel like the system only works for people who are already well established. There are no hard feelings here - but it's just sad - like it makes me wonder what the point of doing a PhD is anymore? 

I feel sad about this because I genuinely love teaching - and I've worked really hard to implement some changes in our curriculum to improve the learning experience for students. It's something I've always cared about and loved doing. But none of that really matters to the institution. 

The crazy thing is despite seeing the flaws in the system there is still a small part of me that hopes to stay. I've been putting off my job search in the hopes that my contract will be renewed, despite knowing that it won't. Maybe because I worked so hard to get here and I feel like it's all for nothing, even though I know it isn't. I've learned a lot in my time as an academic and I can take those experiences and my skills elsewhere where they will be more appreciated and there is more job security. And yet... I still find myself wishing and hoping to stay. But I know if I do, I'll go through this again in 1-2 years time.

My advisor proposed to fund me using the NSF INTERN program for the internship and the hiring manager gladly agreed. The funds requested were $55000 for the 6 month co-op. And NSF gave them to us. 
This is where the problem started. I'd be moving to one of the costliest cities in US for the co-op and out of $55000, my advisor decided to keep 20000 for material supplies which I would never see. So, out of 55000, I'd only get 14000 as stipend. This is less than my PhD stipend at a city where the living cost is 0.25x of the internship city. There's no way I can get rest of the amount.

But poor at learning from textbooks, wikipedia articles etc. Unless the material is really easy to follow, I am unable to learn most of text coantent. How do I practice this? Last semester, I read 5,00,000 words to practice my reading, but I mostly learnt by internet pdfs slides made by various universities teachers rather than the book itself( I did read the book and highlighted all the  facts important, summarized them but I would never reach any conclusion trying to do so), so I am not very confident about my ability to learn from text. Can you share some tips?

This skill is really important once I enter job as well as I am computer engineering student so that is going to be most important as technology keeps changing. I have never found any good advices related to this in stackexchange.


**My issue while learning from textbooks-:**

I fail to connect the dots. It seems overwhelming for me to conclude sth by reading. Whereas while reading slides/notes, it is easy for me to conclude and connect the dots. I don't get bored or distracted, I remember what I have studied if I understand but my problem is that I don't even understand. – 


**Did this happen in past?**

I have very light memories. I remember reading textbooks as well but there used to be tons of videos. And most of my subjects were rather numerical(where you need to do calculations), so reading books was easy for me in that case. But here most of my textbooks are literature(computer science so) and may be some coding(coding isn't really part of most CS subjects contrary to belief).

I choose this problem because I believe it is important, in other side, I am in the process of writing paper, I feel it so much painful to write it in a certain way for the reviewers, most paper are really vague with tons of complicated math and never get the point, now I am afraid to put equations, they said since it isnot in literature, it would kill the paper.

I am so much afraid, I know what I did is working, it is simple, beautiful but in the group's head it is risky and waste of time even if it is worked.

3,Question about teacher assistance and what a professor meant,"Hi I wanted to TA for a professor and he said I could anytime, informally. I asked last week in email and he said “the class will have exams the next two weeks”. I assume that I can’t TA for those weeks, but he never mentioned that I could TA after those exams are done. I would really want to TA but don’t want to pester if he doesn’t actually want me to TA. Do you think he’ll email me after the exams are over to let me know I can TA then? I doubt it, and am contemplating giving up on the idea of TAing for him since he sent that email that didn’t seem too keen on me TAing or even expressing interest in me TAing after the exams are over for his class.",academia,1634507012

7,Is customs going to take all my “textbooks?”,"I finished my degree abroad 2 years ago and started working (still abroad)

Most of the books I used in school were only available to borrow and make copies from the library or I had to buy the translated version, or the professor would essentially just translate the English version of the book to use in the lectures. 

I would often download a pdf of the English version of the textbook and then print it out and put a plastic cover and spiral binding on them to have a physical copy i could take notes on and highlight and also transfer translated notes onto so I could make sure I actually understood the materials. It’s all just for personal use and of course i have no intention of sharing or giving them away. 

I am moving back to the States in a few months and want to ship all my books back. I’ll be sending everything temporarily to my parents’ address until I can get a storage unit and a PO box for myself. I’ve been living abroad for nearly 10 years…

Because they aren’t legal copies of the textbooks , am I going to get in trouble for shipping them? Will they get confiscated and then I’ll lose like 400$ in shipping costs? 

No i will not throw them away. I worked really hard on my own to get my degree while abroad on my own - paid my own way and it took me 5.5 years to finish everything.  They are useful sources for my field of study and also have extreme sentimental value to me. The main reason why I came abroad was for studying, so i want to take them with me.",academia,1634461322

9,Undergraduate research advice,"Hello Professors and graduate students, 

I am a first year that recently got invited to join a research group. I finished all the training 9 days ago, so I emailed the coordinators and included the professor on the email to let them know I am good to go for the next steps. None of them have responded in 8 days, so I emailed them yesterday wishing them well and asking what day would be a good day to move forwards. I'm sure they are busy, so I don't think anything bad of them, but it does stress me out a bit especially since I'm really excited about the project he gave me, I already found a few papers I'd like to bring up. What should I do if they don't respond by Friday? I don't want to be a pest by emailing them again, but I don't want to seem like I don't care about the research group.

Secondly, there is a research scholarship to another country that I want to go on over the summer, but as a first year I doubt I will be given one of the 6 undergraduate slots. I know two of the professors that are also joining the trip, one of them is the professor who offered me a spot in his research group and the other is a professor who is letting me participate in his class. Both are very kind people, but incredibly busy and I was wondering if it would be ok to approach one or both of them about writing me a letter of recommendation for the research scholarship or if I could even just put their name(s) down as references? I have until December to submit my application, so I still have time to work in the research group and complete good classwork to show that I'm worth the letter of recommendation/reference.

20,Bullying/mobbing,"PhD student here seeking advice. I feel like I'm being bullied, but it's deflated my confidence so much I still feel like it could all be my fault. I'll give a rundown of what's happened, as briefly as possible.

Masters year: I suffered some awful personal setbacks that year that I'd rather not go into. The postgraduate convenor was someone I liked before, and I had actually emailed to say how much I was looking forward to dealing with them. When I divulged the issues I was having, they handled it *terribly*, being dismissive and insensitive and giving awful advice. I didn't make a big deal of this at the time, as I understand that if you haven't had a particular experience yourself you probably won't know how to deal with it, but then they then treated me like there was something wrong with me - like I was some kind of leper for having personal problems - for the rest of the year, no matter how nice I was to them.

Somehow I made it through, and handed in a thesis. This was supposed to be returned to me for corrections in a month. *Six months* later I had to contact the admin office to chase it up, and was told the convenor had it in their office for most of this time. The marker is friends with the convenor, and their comments were mostly aggressively bad-faith readings of my work - again this was someone I was friendly and helpful to up to this stage. No factual or structural corrections were recommended - most of the comments were just things they personally didn't like - but despite this I was offered a C grade. Several professors from other departments and institutions have since raved about this thesis and asked me why I haven't got it published yet. 

I got a PhD scholarship after that, and Covid hit about six months in. Like most I was completely lost for a while, but after settling into new routines and giving my project a re-think, I have in the past year produced two conference presentations, given an invited talk at another uni and delivered a public workshop, completed another two paid research jobs for outside organisations, the results of which have been published online, and had two articles published in a popular magazine, on top of doing my PhD research. 

After one of these conference presentations a senior lecturer in my department who has taken great pleasure in making me feel uncomfortable and belittled on many occasions over the years, emailed my supervisors to tell them I'd said things in my presentation that *I just hadn't said*. My supervisors thanked them for their help, despite having read my script. During the other conference the department extravagantly promoted the other two members of the department who were presenting on social media, and said nothing about me. They have not shared any of my published or public work like they routinely do for other students. When I sent my last published article to my supervisors, neither of them even replied to my email.

I emailed our new postgrad convenor - who, surprise! Is friends with the last one - a simple question last week, and received a staggeringly rude and patronising response, that has made me feel wary of contacting them again, or even entering the departmental building. I now effectively no longer have an office anyway, as another postgrad student in the same room took such exception to me being there (for no apparent reason, again this was someone I was friendly and polite to) that they made things incredibly awkward when I was there, and stormed out of any other meetings I showed up to. I spoke to my supervisors about this at the time and absolutely nothing was done, in fact I was made to feel like this is just how things are and I was weird for even bringing it up. 

I just don't get it. I'm here to work, not deal with high school psychological dynamics. Why have half of my department turned against me like this? It makes me feel like I must be doing terrible work and they want rid of me, but I just got an email from *another* publication asking me to write an article for them. It seems like everyone outside of *my* actual uni thinks my work is great. Can someone explain to me WTF is going on here? I oscillate between thinking I must be delusional and that I shouldn't really be here, or that they're all just fuck-ups. I've been close to quitting many times.",academia,1634311522

22,A consistent mosaic(?) plagiarist Historian,"Hello, my father is a local historian (of Balıkesir, Turkey). A few years back, a municipality contacted him asking for contribution to a book about the history of the district. And my father wrote an article with help from his own previous studies and also new researches. The historian who edited the book did not add the article writers names as contributers, at the end of the book there was a list of the writers of each article listed, but the book was published under the name of the editor. And editor did not get in contact after receiving the article. He was in constant contact while my father was creating the article. And later, my father finds out that the book was published on his own. There wasnt even a text telling it was out, let alone a copy of the book.
And years later, same municipality contacts my father with the same question, asking for contribution. And it turns out the assembly has the same members, same historian. My father absolutely declined. 
And i did a little research on this historian with a PhD who is teaching at that district's uni. Recently he had a New book published, and one of his colleague was congratulating him on that via a tweet flood. And there I saw the sentence ""-his efforts on making our students contribute to such a study is praiseworthy."" So basically he also used the works of his students.

However, my supervisor is a titan in my field,  they're incredibly smart, and I don't believe this topic would come up at all if I didn't follow their social media.

I submitted an assignment for a class a few weeks back and was working on the second one today when I realized I may have really messed up. The assignment involved using a few journal articles which I referenced properly. It also involved taking about some jobs. I used google/indeed and the company websites to find information about them like the role and duties to complete my assignment. 

The thing is I just realized today if I was supposed to cite those or not. I was rushing the first assignment last week and the thought never occurred to me that these may need to be cited. Throughout university so far I’ve really only cited journal articles and government websites, but I guess this was since none of my other assignments required other sources like I used in this assignment?

I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking this (I have severe OCD) or I really messed up. I’m just so scared I’ll get academic dishonesty for this and my dream of going to med school will be shattered.

I don’t really know anyone in the class but I asked in a groupchat and they said to cite these just to be safe. I will for this assignment but what about the assignment I already submitted?

Should I email the TA and explain this or is this not something to worry about?

48,Need some urgent advise please,"I need some advice please, I am a graduate student in North America in my last semester and currently working on finishing my thesis. I started my research in Spring 2020, and here I am now having issues with my advisor. Last semester, upon completing the data analysis and sharing the results with him; I told him that now I am going to start the write up, and I am plan to submit the manuscript/and complete my thesis in summer. He agreed to it then, now once I completed the first draft in May, I go to him again to his office as he usually does not reply to his emails, and I tell him that I have completed the draft and is ready for you to review. He asks me can you do this work in summer with your job? And I said yes I can. 

Anyways two weeks go by and he does not get back to me with any feedback, so I send him emails to follow-up but he does not reply. So I go to his office and ask him about the feedback. To which he says he's really busy with another PhD student who graduating next year and his exam is coming up so he is busy with him and that he also busy writing for grants. I am like okay when should I contact you then and he says well I am really busy, so I didn't argue and leave. Then two months go by and he does not reply me with anything, so I go to his office again and ask him about the feedback and now he says well I don't get paid in Summer and I work voluntarily so I did not check any of your work. When he said this, I was so disappointed as he agreed to work with me in summer!!!

Anyways I then tell him that due to my father's health, my family has asked me to graduate as soon as possible and start taking care of the family's responsibilities, thus I have to graduate this year. Then I told him that we should setup an immediate meeting and discuss my thesis. So we meet again in August, and this time he says I was very lazy during my thesis as I was busy with my teaching assistant job, and that if I had not worked in summer and focused on my thesis, I would have been done in summer. When he said this to my face I was so disappointed like how can you give me three contradictory statements about not working with me in summer and now you blame it all on me. In my head I am thinking how am I lazy when I completed my draft and emailed it you in May and that I completed the data analysis even before that. But I kept quite because I felt like if I argue now it will ruin my relationship with him. 

Since August, we have met at least once a week to discuss my progress but we are still on Chapter 1, so I was getting the feeling that I will not graduate. So I met with him again and said we need to set a deadline to send the thesis to my committee, he does give me a date and then I tell him that due to my family situation both financially and because of my father's health, I absolutely cannot afford another semester. I also told him that as you are aware of my epilepsy and the medication I take to control it (Depakote) also has its side effects and so too much stress is not good for my mental health. So I said I will give it my best but I have to graduate in any case, to which he says if it's insufficient (I don't know what he means by that as he already knows the results of the analysis and that I gave him the draft in May) then you have to decide whether you want to quit or stay another semester. He also wants me to publish and I told him I don't have time for that and it's not a degree requirement so I want to focus on my thesis only. He does not agree to that either. 

I thought of talking to someone who handles such situations, but I googled about such issues and found out that if that person is senior professor and famous in research then the college might not be of much help me due to politics. I don't want to complain, I just want a solution to graduate. But most people online say that if you go this route then you are burning all bridges with your advisor and I may not get much benefit out of it. So here I am having a sleep less night of anxiety and panic worried about my future, my mental illness, and the future of my family tied to me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Oh and this advisor is from another department and my department chair said he can't intervene.  What should I do, as I only have a month or month and a half to defend my thesis.",academia,1634124547

54,Enjoying studying and the academic environment for its own sake. Advice?,"I recently finished my undergraduate degree in philosophy, it went really well and I achieved the grade I wanted. I chose my degree based on enjoying doing my degree for its own sake, rather than for the sake of some further goal beyond university. I chose a very general degree, since it applies to so many things and I was sure of my interest in the subject. 

I think the academic environment suits me well and I really enjoy it, and I’d love to immerse myself in it again. But I’m not sure where to go from here, since I haven’t really developed a long term career plan. I was unable to formulate much of a plan of action in my final year during the Covid online class circumstances.

The Ann Radcliffe Academic Conference is part of the Horror Writers Association’s Outreach Program. Created in 2016 by Michele Brittany and Nicholas Diak, the Ann Radcliffe Academic Conference has been a venue for horror scholars to present their work. The conference has also been the genesis of the Horror Writer Association’s first academic release, *Horror Literature from Gothic to Post-Modern: Critical Essays*, comprised entirely of AnnRadCon presenters and was released by McFarland in February, 2020.

Membership to the Horror Writers Association is not required to submit or present, however registration to StokerCon 2022 is required to be accepted and to present. StokerCon registration can be obtained by going to https://www.stokercon.com. There is no additional registration or fees for the Ann Radcliffe Academic Conference outside StokerCon registration. If interested in applying to the Horror Writer’s Association as an academic member, please see [www.horror.org/about/](http://www.horror.org/about/).

StokerCon is the annual convention hosted by the Horror Writers Association wherein the Bram Stoker Awards for superior achievement in horror writing are awarded.",academia,1633968700

63,Keeping up with documentation of samples in (STEM research),"I wanted to know how people are organizing all they do in the lab. 
I have: 
Raw materials
Synthezised powders and
Pressed pellets

Of different compositions, heat treatments and shape and sizes.

I tried making an spreadsheet but not everything can go inside a table. 

For example: target elemental composition and actually weighed in ratios and measured composition. That makes more sense in an extra table. But this happens for many different kind of information where an extra table makes more sense and now I have 10 tables and it feels like it loses its initial usefulnes.

I tried setting up a MS Access Database but this seems overkill.

64,How do I prepare to be a professor before I'm done with school?,"Hi. So, currently, I'm a minimum wage monkey. I'm almost done with a bachelor's in Geography with a GIS specialization. At this point, I'm used to everybody asking ""now what on earth are you going to do with a degree in that?"" and the honest answer is- I haven't the slightest. However, I am vividly passionate about academia and so I am very interested in becoming a professor. The problem is, I'm terrified that I'll bust my hump to get through school only to find my low-level work experience isn't going to cut it in the big leagues. Every time I apply for an internship or job that's Geography or Education-related (even lower level stuff like tutoring), I don't get the job. I've had well-rounded family members look over my resume again and again so I don't feel like that's the problem. Over time, this has been deteriorating my self-esteem and drive. My biggest fear is waking up one day and I'm still working my same old minimum wage job despite some degrees. I don't feel confident that just graduating will get me a job as a professor, there must be more I should be doing. How can I break the minimum wage cycle and make my way into academia? Is there anything that I can be doing now to make it easier to become a professor in the future? What can help me figure out if I really want to be a professor? Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.",academia,1633949553

66,How to know when someone is a Professor?,"Apologies if this is not aloud in this subreddit. I work in admin at a university and sometimes have difficulties knowing an academics title. I understand if they have a doctorate, they are Dr Lastname. How do I know if someone is a Professor Lastname?

If someone's job is, for example, 'Professor of Economics at University of London' (made up job), would they always be a Professor Lastname? Is the title of professor entirely dependant on being in that job, as in, would they no longer be a professor if they worked elsewhere? Can non-professors hold such a position?

Is is possible for a professor to have a job which doesn't have the work professor in, for example 'Senior Research Fellow at University of Paris' or 'Research Director at Economics Institute'?

Are these questions dependant on geographic location? I am in the UK, but from what I see in American films, all academics are called professor.

Thank-you for any insight.",academia,1633943588
67,Unreasonable workload in an undergrad research project,"Last week, my research advisor told me to create a simple simulation for our project over the weekend. The project is to span the entire academic year and we have four other researchers on our team, each with a different speciality. The goal of the whole project itself is to create a computer simulation of a complex phenomenon and to analyze it. 

It feels like I’ve been asked to do something so massive that was supposed to take months of collaborating on my own, despite it being a “simpler” version. Moreover, my strong suit is math and stats, not programming. In fact, we have another researcher who’s speciality is programming and we were all a but confused as to why he wasn’t asked to do this! I barely know any python (our preferred language), definitely not enough to design an entire simulation, and I made that clear when I was brought on. And I even brought this problem up this week at our research meeting, that I wasnt able to create a simulation because I have absolutely no idea where to even start. I was given some pointers but those weren’t helpful at all. And now I have to go in this coming week and tell my team, once again, that I was unable to create a simulation because im so lost. Our research advisor was supposed to send me material that would help last week but he forgot, and he forgot to do it again this week. So I can’t help but feel like I’ve been given an unfair amount of work to do on my own. 

The expected workload for this project is supposed to be 5 hrs per week, but I’ve already spent so many more hours learning numerical methods on python, and am expected to spend a whole lot more to create this simulation!? That doesn’t sound right at all and I’ve already embarrassed myself enough when I couldn’t produce anything. At this point, I’m probably just gonna call in sick to avoid the embarrassment again. 

Am I in the wrong here? Is research actually this much work, even if it was literally in our contract that it’d only be 5-7 hrs per week? Because my previous research experiences definitely weren’t like this. Its making me want to walk away from this- which I know is a terrible thing to do mid-project.

70,Question for academics in maths &amp; biology fields,"I'm starting to become interested in the differences between the academic cultures of (applied) mathematics on one side and biology, specifically neuroscience, on the other. I am a UK math. neuro PhD student but due to Covid I've not had the daily interactions with people in my two departments (applied maths and neuroscience) to understand the differences between the academic cultures and practise of each. 

If there were people that have experience working in both experiential (not necessarily neuro/biological) and a mathematical departments of a university, I would like to know what, if any, differences there are. Of course everyone's experience is dependent on the departments and the people in them but I'd like to figure out if there's any underlying trends. 

Finally, I don't even know if there are any differences. Like I said, Covid had reduced my experience of academic culture to video supervisor meetings and a few online conferences. Only recently have I been doing experiments and going to talks in my university. So maybe if you can't think of any differences between the two fields, you could describe how covid has altered your experience of being an academic.

71,I have spent 7 months on a postdoc and I have not yet started the project I was alloted to. How do I convey this to my advisor and collaborators?,"I have been struggling with my postdoc. Since June 2020, I have been working on 5 different projects. 2 had been as a co-author (second author) capacity. I did some simulations or made some models that took me total 4 months of dedicated efforts.
One got recently published, another in review.

Other one project was my own endeavor. My advisor gave me freedom to choose my side projects. I chose a very new area and worked for 6 months to complete the project. It is under review as well.

Another project was in collaboration with a different group, I completed it in July 2021. It took me more than 7 months because I was not confident with my results and wanted to do more with the project before writing the first draft. It will be soon submitted, hopefully in a month.

However, since March 2021, I am being funded through a grant where I have to do quite different work. And I have failed miserably with it. I have not even done 10% of the job. The truth is I have been struggling with my mental health since last year. My mental ability have reduced, the capacity to retain information has reduced. I can't concentrate and am working just 6-7 hours daily. 

My meeting with advisor and collaborators is scheduled within a month and I don't know how can I let them know that I have been wasting time and money all this time. I screwed up. I should have been more than 70% complete till now.

73,Interesting Results on Twitter Poll (Ongoing),"I thought I would share the current results of a recent Twitter poll, that was spurred on by a rather odd Twitter exchange. Perhaps I'm being too hard on fellow academics. Or perhaps I'm not being hard enough. 

The question was as follows: ***Should academics be held to a superior standard, as compared to the average person, when it comes to justifying claims made on Twitter?*** 

I honestly thought the results would be a bit more even. The skew is, fairly interesting. I'm curious what r/academia's thoughts are. Given that there's a demand for a certain level of scholarly rigor on a lot of academic subreddits, many of which even require a source to be peer reviewed, what do you think about the standard to which academics should be held to, when they're discussing issues, making claims on science, education, etc.?

74,"I've seen other similar posts, but how competitive are PhD programs?","I'm applying through a doctoral program (CHASE, UK) and from what I've heard they're really hard to get on to; as a slight bonus, I'm automatically applied for a fellowship with just my institution when I apply to CHASE. I'm currently doing my MA.

I'm currently 'advisor shopping', and my undergrad advisor who I planned to ask left as I graduated. I emailed him and the ones who I'd seen he said all looked suitable other than 1 as she as going on maternity leave. However, none of them are exact fits as much as my undergrad advisor for my dissertation was. Nonetheless I'm still happy to explore the field with an advisor who knows a little less as just learning how to write on an even higher level is what I think I'll need guidance with the most.

I spoke to a course advisor-application-person yesterday and she said my research topic seemed very interesting and suitable for the program I'm applying for. She said write a 1 page plan which I've almost finished, and to find an advisor or maybe even 2.

So when applying and presenting for a spot on the program, what will make me stand out more? From what I understood, 2 advisors may be beneficial for not only my learning, but looking better. Secondly, my undergrad advisors research field hasn't been replaced as far as I'm aware, should I use this as an advantage and say I want to replace him (because honestly I do)? Do I also talk about how I'm not only willing, but happy to teach? I want to go into lecturing but I don't know if this comes into consideration when simply being selected for the program.

I know I can apply every year but obviously I don't want to be waiting to start my career for a couple years, I really want this. Thanks",academia,1633807994

90,What in the hell is Honors?,"I am a final year BSc Physics student in an obscure university of an Asian country. Everything around here is sub-standard and a piss-poor replica of the prestigious universities of the West (I regret being born here). As part of the final year ""Honors project"", we the students are required to submit some thesis sort of thing, upon doing which we are conferred the B.Sc Hons degree. Failing to do so will only earn a normal B.Sc degree.

Honestly, I don't really understand what it is that we are supposed to do exactly. My teachers didn't bother to explain and I bet that's because they aren't sure themselves. I was assigned the topic of Applications of Fractional Calculus in Physics, but unfortunately, my supervisor is the busiest man in the world. That's right, I was ***assigned.*** I didn't get to choose my subject. Not like having that freedom of choice would have been any better. Everything around here is so utterly hopeless.

Are we really required to do **research** at this tender stage?  I mean, as bachelors we aren't even quite done with the fundamentals yet. We still have graduate studies and even after that, especially nowadays, coming up with anything close to a new idea (even leaving its usefulness aside) is a herculean task, one that requires extensive collaboration between highly skilled people and a great deal of time. How can they expect **bachelors** to do this within the meager span of one year all the while handling the regular coursework?? Isn't this whole idea of ""Honors research"" absolute bonkers?!

I discussed this with some of my seniors who had been awarded the Hons degree. They told me to just ""not give up hope and work hard"". I mean, seriously?? I lost my patience and asked them if I could go through their ""Hons thesis"" work. I was relieved to find that they were nothing more than half-assed attempts at plagiarizing other real research works. No wonder they were ""still in review"" and never approved.

I happen to be the class topper here, unfortunately. And please, don't you guys even think that it means anything to me, anything at all. I was planning to drop out of Hons all together. I'd rather play dumb than risk pretending to be a genius, publishing a half-assed copy-cat ""research paper"" and putting my future reputation at stake. But my proud parents don't approve of this.

I was wondering if anyone here who has done Hons work under the proper guidance of a skilled supervisor from a good university, could shed some light on what the hell this Honors business is all about. Also, given the miserable state of my university, I was thinking if it would be possible to look for supervisors from other universities who are willing to accept and guide a student from a university not their own.

Hello everyone

I am currently a PhD student in one of the imperial universities in Japan and have published 6 journal articles with 3 of them as 1st author (still writing 2 more papers before graduation). I am 29 M from SEA and can communicate in English at intermediate level. Now that this is my final year in my graduate study, I’m looking into what I should do next. My first option is to look for a post doc position preferably in NA or EUR, but I am quite scared that I’ll experience the same laboratory workload here in Japan. As you may already know the work-life balance here is terrible, which why I’m also not considering applying for industrial jobs here after graduating. I would like to use the post doc position to jump start my career in a different country since if I return home the only job that will fit my resume is in academia. I’m not saying that a job in academia is bad, but seeing how the professors work here just makes me think that it is not the life I would’ve wanted for me and my future family. Obtaining a research job in industry in NA or EUR is probably the best scenario but considering that I am from a 3rd world country makes my chances of getting a direct job offer low. What do you think I should do? Is anyone here have similar situation and have successfully obtained a job offer elsewhere? Am I planning too early and should just focus in completing my PhD?

I've got a project due in soon, an 8 page lit review on any topic in my subject area. 
I've not done one before so at a disadvantage to my peers already, and I can't figure out how specialised it should be for 8 pages long. 

My topic is relating to AI in disease diagnostics, but I don't know if I should focus on just one disease (ie breast cancer), a group of diseases (multiple cancers) or various groups of different diseases (eg. heart disease, breast cancer, covid, Alzheimer's). 

Im concerned if I do the final option it'll be too varied and hard to link section, but if I stick to the first one it's too narrow and I'll run out of things to comment on. Multiple cancers seems like a good option but there are so many cancers I again feel it could be too broad",academia,1633449668

It is fairly evident, academia functions under the clout of a very few who have / bring money to the organization. This has fostered some of the most degrading practices in the work culture which chips into the self-esteem of trainees, normalizes the customs while perpetuating it, while ensuring no recourse is available which can provide safe and secure support to academic trainees (PhDs and postdocs).

Publication wise, I have 5 first authored papers in my PhD and 2 coauthored. Since last year, I have coauthored 2 papers and a first authored paper is under review in a good journal. I can publish many more papers in my field and am confident to learn new techniques.

However, there are two fundamental issues with my career path.

1) I am a simulation guy. I don't do experiments. I use finite element method and solid mechanics to predict experimental outcomes in additive manufacturing. Industry, postdocs and faculty positions require experimental research experience. I have very limited (during my masters thesis). However, I am not good at mathematics and coding. It is limiting the level of rigor I can bring to my research.


2) I have poor grades during my undergrad and grad school. I did not take enough relevant courses out of fear of failing. I self studied whatever was required to get my research going. However, this made my foundations very shaky and I am not confident of my knowledge. Technically, I shouldn't have got my PhD, but here I am. Now, I am not fit for any job as everyone requires strong education background.
Considering these factors, I have realized that I am not fit for academia. But truth be told, I am not fit for industry as well. What would I do now! I have no clue. I am 32. I always wanted to be an academic or a research scientist. Now, I can't picture myself in any of the roles.

Backstory: I managed a research lab in my undergrad. For the first several years, my supervisor would just make us mine old data no matter how unethical it was. Eventually I did an honours thesis which was a very successful project (published, invited talks, etc.) so my supervisor shifted all her attention to it. The two of us even started a follow up study. 

Now I am in grad school with a different supervisor (who is an angel, thankfully), but I was informed today from the new lab manager of my old lab that my old supervisor is allowing lab students full access to my data to mine and present whatever they find at conferences etc. I would have no knowledge of this otherwise, because the old supervisor never even discussed it with me.

A combination of being depressed and lazy, and not sticking to a topic). Long story short, I finished the requirements, wrote a below average dissertation (derived from a below average set of publications), and got the degree. It's not that I didn't like research or the area that I was working in, it's just that I didn't do well for various reasons, including the ones listed above. I really regret not pushing harder.

I now work in the industry as an ML engineer. At first, I was excited to learn all the new tooling and the codebase, but now I'm bored with the work. It's not because there aren't opportunities to innovate or to go above and beyond and create new tooling that will help other devs/clients, but it's mainly because I'm not that passionate about software engineering. Unfortunately, the fact that the product isn't that appealing to me makes matters worse. I just don't feel excited about SWE or creating products.

I dream about going back to academia but the sacrifices required (geographic instability, low pay, reasons that made quit in the first place) quickly make me come back to reality. In fact, to be honest, given how badly I did during grad school makes me question my competence as far as doing research is concerned.

I feel lost and life feels meaningless, to the point that my mental health has started deteriorating again.

52,My post-coursework portion of my doctorate has left me completely disinterested in higher education,"I'm currently ABD in a music degree. I did three years of coursework and assistantship, followed by four written comprehensive exams, an oral exam, and the dissertation. This latter half will end up (if I'm lucky) taking as long as the coursework did.

I absolutely loved my first three years. It was the most educational, fulfilling, supportive, inspiring, and meaningful part of my life in music. I loved my assistantship work very much. It was incredibly intensive and time consuming, as I'm sure some you can imagine, and while I wouldn't trade it for anything it did prevent me from looking forward towards the other requirements I would need to complete. This doesn't bother me so much though because of how beneficial and fulfilling it was.

The problem I ran into is that it seems like no one in the faculty or administration understood how the rest of the degree was supposed to work, and it seemed like no one including my primary advisor had any particular interest in me (or any doctoral student) graduating. I did my first written exam, and didn't hear back from the professor for months. The exam instructions were broad and vague and I realized after the first one that they were made out to be far more difficult than they actually were. I was also confused because my exams had little or nothing to do with my degree focus or the work I did in my coursework - no relationship to the classes I took, etc. It almost felt like I was being scared into over-preparing and then given an easy pass. One of the four exams I felt I truly didn't deserve to pass, but nonetheless I wasn't even given a stipulation. A lot of heartache over nothing.

Music performance isn't a hard research degree, and I did no significant research of any kind during my time as a student. I'm not a bad writer or researcher (relatively), and have no problem putting in the time, but it seems like every time I bring something to my committee some previously unmentioned and not insignificant aspect or focus comes up that I need to work into the document. It almost feels like whatever passing thought they have in our meetings suddenly becomes a major concern. I have total respect for everyone on my committee but the manner and suddenness with which concerns are expressed doesn't seem constructive to me, and sometimes feels like hardship is being added for its own sake.

And then things that result from mixed messages and miscommunications. One advisor has mentioned this extra written exam that I need to do, but not all advisors in the school of music adhere to it and the graduate office nor my course catalog has any indication of it. One tells me I need to be enrolled for this credit this semester, another says I don't need it. It seems like the requirements have more to do with who I'm talking to than some clear set of completion guidelines.

This has killed my interest in college teaching. The backfighting, lack of clarity, and perceived lack of educational purpose has left me so confused and with a distaste for academia. Much of this process has seemed like some have decided it should be hard, and the difficulty is imposed whether necessary or not in a given task. I have every reason to believe I was a good student and graduate assistant for those first few years, and that now the educational purpose is to undergo a certain amount of suffering and a delay of moving on with life. I could never in good conscience teach a student to become a better musician and colleague and pretend that all of this post-coursework work has anything to do with that.

If I had better understood what I was going to have to do, I think I could have completed the degree less a year's time. I'm sure this isn't a unique experience, but I'm failing to understand the purpose of all this. Is/was anyone else's doctoral experience similar?",academia,1633040538

What I can glean seems like it might be bad advice. I'm starting to wonder if there's anything I could do to make this reviewer happy short of writing an entirely new article.

I’ve been dealing with a strong case of imposter syndrome since I began, and I don’t feel like I can communicate well with anyone in the lab because they’re all doing their own things. Everyone else has been there longer and can churn out data like it’s the easiest thing in the world, but I’ve been trying to get the simplest thing to work for several weeks and nothing is going right. I talk to my supervisor about results and possible things I could do to fix my methods, but discussion never goes anywhere and now I get such bad anxiety everytime I talk to my supervisor because they have high expectations for me. I know it’s normal for experiments to fail, but I feel I’m being expected to produce the same level of work as a grad student and whenever I fail I’m seen as a burden. My supervisor always tells me about how other people in lab are doing all these great things and how I should be more invested in what I’m doing.

- 1 email regarding reviewing an abstract (requested)
- 1 email about reviewing a paper (requested)
- 1 email follow up about our meeting on 25.08 regarding supplementary documents (requested)
- 1 email about bureaucracy stuff
- 1 email about asking for another video meeting
- 1 Follow up email to all the emails, that they did not answer my emails and that the deadline of the abstract is on the 1st of October 

I called twice, both went to the secretary who advised me the first time to send an email, which I did. The second time they told me the same and I refused, saying that I already send 6 and I do not see the point in sending 7. So they offered to take a note and since then (a week) there is still no news.

83,Applying out as an associate prof is weird,"BIG DISCLAIMER: I'm writing this on here rather than my socials because it's a real thing, but it's also a thing that is likely to garner some backlash (understandably) and I don't mind downvotes but I'd hate to actually fuck myself by sharing something in a non-anonymous space that people found really objectionable.

With that out of the way, IT'S SO FUCKING WEIRD to be on the job market again.

It's privileged-weird, since obviously I in fact *do* have a tenured job and so there's something that feels bizarre about giving that up.

But, it's also anxiety-weird, since I'm trying to get a different job *because* there's a significant misalignment between my current institution/role and my own trajectory.

Like, nobody owes me a more powerful career or anything. And I feel guilty to be applying out for jobs when I already have a secure one in a good location. BUT, the working conditions at my current job are kind of fucked up and they're looking to get worse (I think that's true for a lot of public R2s and low-end R1s, by the way, and it's definitely true for a lot of non-prestigious SLACs; working conditions are already pretty fucked up at a lot of regional comprehensives and community colleges). So, I'm on the market to try to secure a somewhat better future for myself (in our era of monumental insecurity and looming collapse).

And, it's weird. It feels weird to go ask people for letters of rec. It's wildly anxiety-inducing to consider giving up tenure. It's highly uncomfortable to start feeling super-divested from my current institution even as I'm very much still in the middle of all kinds of institutionally located projects (location-specific grants, political machinations, run-of-the-mill service to try to keep the lights on, etc.).

The whole machinery of academia (like capitalism) hinges on growth.

Before you tenure, there's an implicit assumption that your growth might happen anywhere--the institution hasn't committed to you, and you're not committed to it. It's *WAY HARDER* to be on the job market as a doc student or a postdoc or a lecturer or an asst prof. There's no comparison. So much harder. But, it feels *weirder* to be on the market as an assoc prof. It feels like I've got to present as totally moveable a growth trajectory that, actually, isn't totally moveable--or, at least, will be pretty difficult at best to move.

Anyhow, I'm sharing that here because (a) it helps me to and (b) it's a perspective that I never see shared in here and that somebody else might identify with and find useful.

84,Question about the utility of an online masters degree.,"Hello, first time poster in this sub. I am thinking about starting a PhD next year after a hiatus of a few years, and I want to know how helpful will the credits of an online program be. I did a Psychology program that involved 4 years of coursework plus a written thesis. I was set to go do a PhD in Europe 3 years ago (I am in Latin America), but I faced severe health and family issues, and they took a while to solve. When I did, the pandemic and ablsolute absence of funding hit my country, and it became a bit more difficult. Regardless, I got back on my feet, and the plan to do a PhD became possible again.   


My plan is to do a joint PhD in my country and a foreign nation (France, Italy, Holland or Germany have great research teams in the field in which I want to do my project). There are much more accesible funding programs for this kind of PhD, and France specially has a lot of calls for aplications for nationals of my country with an existing offer from a local university. The thing is that my country accepts to enter a PhD without a masters degree (provided you have a 4 year BS). So, to be able to also be accepted in another institution, many places ask for a 1 year masters. I am reaching a certain age, and I cannot really leave my job for a 2 years program (or leave the country for a shorter one). The solution I found was to do a masters degree that comprises 60 ECTS and pay for it myself. This is offered on many Spanish universities, and the prices are very accesible.   


This is where things get tricky. Spain divides its Masters degrees into ""Proper"" and ""Official"". Official masters degrees are meant to get you to do a 3 year PhD, and are validated by the Spanish government. Proper masters degrees are validated by the university and its prestige, and are meant to be either for  professional or academic devellopment (as opposed to exclusivelly academic).  Proper masters degrees do not  necessarily have all of their instructors be doctors, and at least in Spain, they do not conduct to a doctorate. This distinction seems inexistent elsewhere. Italians allow you to do a doctorate if you have a specialty (5 year BS), and similar rules apply in Germany and France. I just don't know for sure how admissions work.

I have the possibility of doing  a couple of proper masters degrees, both distance and online. One of them is in cognitive science, with 100% of its faculty being professors. The second one is in data science, with a lot of its instructors being in industry. This one is much more applied. My question is, if I get accepted to the PhD in my local university, and at the same time I can go joint with a foreign university, will this count towards my program? Like will they see it and say: ""No, this are not valid credits?"". My other question is: Do you think they will count towards a better chance for admissions? Honestly my take is to be admitted to my local uni first. I already have a professor that said I have a place in his lab, and most of his students have done PhDs with external advisors, and he funds his students for at least a year in foreign institutions. After that, get accepted in a foreign school with this joint kind of funding; but I need to be eligible for PhD.   


I have a very good CV, and the professors recommeniding me have had students go to very good institutions around the world. I am more interested about the degree counting to make me eligible for a 3 year PhD program in other places. Thank you very much for your time.",academia,1632723884

This is also my first teaching experience, so there's a lot to learn.

Our faculty has the option to upload a pre-recorded video for class in Moodle. So the real live class can be used for a Q&amp;A session or a short discussion session. Any tips on a good way to bring up student engagement during this kind of lesson?

1. How often should this Q&amp;A session or short discussion be? Every week? or only after each topic ends?
2. Should I upload the question first to make the student ponder it before class and stimulate a discussion later? Or let the student submit what they want to ask prior?
3. Is the slide formatting important (looking nice, all the pics, font size, not too wordy etc.), or it does not this matter as long as the information is there? Honestly, this takes up the prepping time too. 
4. For student, what usually make you interested in contributing during discussion or actively participating in online class?

2,Like learning about neuroscience in class but not doing research,"I am a graduate student in computational neuroscience.

I recently realized that while I like computational neuroscience, I only like learning about it but not doing research in it. 

There is this professor who I worked with who teaches a class about computer vision and biological vision. Like he makes these comparisons like how the biological vision actually is implements laplacian filters and difference of gaussians, which are early computer vision techniques. I really like it and like thinking about it.

But I have worked in research in this area and I find it a torture. It is nothing like learning it in class because I work on a very small thing, so it is nothing like learning about the topic.

I wonder if this is telling me that I actually just like learning classes, but not research.

I actually studied neuroscience for undergrad because I thought it was interesting. (bad idea now I think about it)

The idea of experimental research also does not appeal to me. It seems like doing a lot of grunt work to find a very small, maybe insignificant thing.

Does this sound like I only like learning but not doing research? 

I do like doing (graduate level) statistical analysis. Is statistics/mathematical research anything like doing statistics/maths in class?

1. The class is right 1hr after i just got my 2nd dose Pfizer shot. I got the worse headache, feeling lethargic but the class is compulsory as LIVE and cannot be postponed as it is the 1st class of semester.

2. Slide stuck halfway. I've been going on and on for 15-20min only to find out they are still looking at that previous slide from ages ago. Why no one said anything earlier?

3. I feel like the slide sucks so bad coz all the pretty and interesting facts i put in is not as attractive because of the above problem. Imagine having to go through it all over again. MP4 video sound attached in power point also doesn't work.

4. Student are literally unresponsive. No one turns on their camera and it feels like i'm talking to the wall.

4. New slides preparation take up so much of my time that I'm literally breathing slides and references and books. And coffee. I'm teaching 4 course with 3 hour each. I dread thinking that this will have to be on repeat until the rest of the semester. Manuscript for publication has been put to the back burner. I'm trying to find the balance in time management.

5. I'm starting to feel like the long hours spent preparing the slide is not really worth it. But its also because I'm taking it as seriously as I was I'm preparing my phd viva defense slide. 

6. I can see that some of the other new/senior lecturer and my previous lecturer/prof doesn't even bother creating an attractive slides. Just a copy paste situation. I'm starting to wonder if i should do the same.

17,"Im not sure what graduate field my interests would be categorized as, please help?","BS Mathematics

Published a couple papers in astrophysics journals with my mentor. The papers regarded some new techniques and corresponding algorithms for statistics - it began as an Astronomy thing and ended up as a general statistical technique. Spent a couple years in this phase post graduation.

Then I went into corporate America for a few more years. System analysis, software engineering. 

Along the way what I have learned is that im not passionate about any one science or field, but rather im passionate about being pointed at gnarly problems and using math and computer science to solve them. I'm now getting bored with corporate life and want back into research. My ideal life is essentially as a research mercenary who just helps other academics or professionals do their work by providing a skill set they might not have - i.e.: the more mathematical or computery bits. This is basically exactly what I did for my mentor in undergrad and afterwards, and it's exactly how I cut my teeth in corporate life doing analysis and engineering. 

So my question is what this best falls under. Im still at first steps stages so im not sure yet what departments or programs to look into. Applied math? Comp sci? What best fits the niche description I gave above? Does it even matter? One of my colleagues in the physics department got his PhD in physics and now does sports analytics so maybe not too much.

Since this was a new theory that was developed to tackle the problem of metabolic control, there seemed to be no consensus among its early proponents as to the specific nomenclature and proper application. It seems every time a new journal was issued there was another salty letter in the back from one scientist in response to another for something insulting thing they said.

I recently started at an MA program in a humanities field (think sociology, philosophy, history, etc.) and I've realized pretty quickly that although I enjoy the academic aspect of it, I would realistically have no prospects of academic employment if I go down the Ph.D. route after my MA (the job market is practically non-existent at this point). In light of this, I am considering switching fields. I took a few finance courses in undergrad and found them really interesting so I'm looking to apply to master's programs in finance in order to break into the field (it's really difficult to break into it with my current background; plus most finance master's programs are specifically geared towards non-business people who want to make the transition to business).

In any case, my worry is this: Part of the application requires me to submit two letters of recommendation. Now, I am concerned that if I ask my current professors/supervisor for a recommendation, they might not only look down upon my choice of leaving academia but may also think of me as a ""sell-out"" because of my decision to go into something like finance (people in my field can be very elitist/snobby that way). I'm concerned that this attitude may further reflect in their recommendations and really hinder my prospects of getting into a good program. In this case, how should I approach the process of getting a recommendation? Should I ask my undergrad professors instead (though I doubt they'll be any less elitist/snobby)? Should I try to have a frank conversation with my current profs about what they think of my decision?

* *TLDR: Citation management software doesn't seem to have the best tools for organising information, looking for software that may provide a literature matrix or similar experience, or other useful features beyond citation management.*

this isn't meant to be a rant, I have just been looking for an approach to this issue for some time and wanted to really describe my thought process behind it. I have been an avid user of reference management software for most of my academic life, first starting on an earlier (and clunkier) version of EndNote, before eventually finding my way into the loving embrace of Mendeley. Whilst I love Mendeley and will likely continue to use it, these days I constantly seem to feel like my toolbox is missing something fundamental. Mendeley has a basic note-taking/annotation feature, but beyond that, meaningfully organising the information inside an article becomes an external job - often leading to lots of word documents and file systems which become frustrating to navigate and pollute the desktop with open tabs. It also results in difficulties keeping track of individual bits of research and/or comparing that data across separate studies.  

I suppose what I envision is being able to utilise something like a literature-matrix system, but contained within some sort of software that is better equipped to do it as opposed to having to create Excel workbooks and manually tab around entering data. I often wish Mendeley could pull the reference list from research PDFs and display it along its sidebar so I can review the full reference entry without having to scroll back and forth some 15+ pages.

I apologise for not being more succinct, it's just been an evolving frustration haha. Are there any recommendations for software that may possess features similar to what I am getting at, or a more advanced citation management system?",academia,1632294281

50,New adjunct,"So I’m a new adjunct and I feel like I’m getting hosed. Any insight is appreciated. Short version:

- Semester started 1st week of September
- school is a mid-major teaching uni in mid-Atlantic 
- Still don’t have an appointment letter. 
- haven’t been paid yet
- emailed chair multiple times, no response.
- Assistant dean finally got back to me and said, “should have something by last week of September from academic affairs. You need to be more patient.”

Question: Is this par for the course? Or should I never do this again?

52,Paper getting published - final approval before publication.,"I complete an MSc in 2019 and the dissertation I complete for this was a case study on two organizations that focuses on their social media usage between 2018/2019. 

Since the paper was originally submitted in 2019, I have been working on getting it published. It was accepted for publication in April for an annual business review that will be released at the end of this year.

I have just been informed that the copy-editing stage has been completed. Since April there have been some new developments in the industry where the two organizations operate.

I'm wondering if I should try and see if I can update the paper to include the information or should I keep it as it is?

As the copyediting has been complete, would it be normal for the paper to be given to the authors for final approval before going to publication?

56,[Business and Social Science] What is the point of a graphical business model?,"Hey all, 

I am re-writing an academic paper because an interest organization have a (surprise) interest in reading about it. The academic paper was a case study, and required me to make an as-is and a to-be business model, i.e. what does it look like now, and what should the subject of the study move towards.

As such, a business model was required. The organization I studied, and others like it (which the interest organization provides advice and resources to), rarely uses business models, since they're public agencies, and have written ""laws"" on how to be governed, through which business model elements are stated. For example, I was able to fill out most of business model canvas, simply by referring to this document.

This made me think about the reason for having the graphical representation of a business model, which finally brings me to my question: What reason is there for having that graphical representation?

Academic sources would be appreciated, if available.

58,I hate myself for doing well in school.,"This may seem like a really stupid thing to be worried about, but please hear me out.
I've always done well in school despite not studying hard. I used to love it when people called me a ""genius"" and told me I didn't need to work hard because I was smart. Now, everytime i'm praised for academic related things I just want to throw up. My parents are so proud of me and yet all I do is text friends and listen to music. I feel so disgusting. I don't deserve the good grades, not when my sister works so hard and never gets the grades she should. I put on a fake smile when I get my report card back, celebrate with my family and convince myself i'm happy, but i'm not. I don't feel anything because I didn't work for it. My friends have blisters on their fingers from studying too much, and I can't even make myself finish my homework. Everyone tells me that if i'd just put in more effort I could go to any university I want. While I do like the idea of it, I don't think i'm mentally strong enough to actually start studying to get in. I live in Japan where studying for entrance exams in very brutal and a huge commitment.Just because I don't study doesn't mean I have no worries about exams. I have a crippling fear of failure and letting people down, yet when I sit down to study I can hear the voice telling me that I don't need to, that i'll do well either ways. This makes me feel very unstable, and I have zero confidence in whatever I do. It's all my fault and i'm incredibly stupid for being like this. How do I change myself?

61,Is my academic career over?,"Hi all. 
I’m a phd student at a US university, currently in my 8th year but with no publications. For the past 6 years I’ve been working mostly on the same problem, but, whenever I reach a landmark, my advisor raises the bar for me to publish the work. The problem itself is quite difficult and their goals are very ambitious (possibly driven by the fact that it’s not in their main area of expertise), so the work that I’ve done has, admittedly, many loose threads. I’ve written an entire paper in the past on my advisor’s request, but they refused to submit it in the end, claiming that the work needed to be further extended. I worry that this will keep happening indefinitely. They also are against conference papers and most students in my research group finish their degrees with no publications whatsoever. I have been told that I can graduate and leave with no publications, if I would like to do so.
On top of that, I’ve failed to build a network and make contacts outside of my department. I don’t know who I can turn to ask for help.
I am constantly worried that this means that I am very unlikely to be able to further pursue my career in academia, which has been my main goal.

70,Should I appologize for an email I sent to my supervisor or am I just overthinking?,"I'm an MSc student based in the UK. Started my study in 2018 but still have not graduated yet due to complicated personal circumstances and covid that I had to extend the submission of my final project report 3 times, because of this there is some tension between me and my supervisor.  I remember the first time I applied for mitigating circumstances I didn't notice him beforehand, he was visibile angry with me about it after he was notified. I was severely depressed for a while so sometimes I couldn't keep up with the mandatary weekly meeting with him, he was just telling he would report me to university due to my visa conditions. He was unhappy and said to me along the lines of: ""You see, I have been trying to help you, why couldn't you just do it"". I recently found out my project was listed as a PHd project for student recruitment online somewhere, so I guess this project is somewhat important to my supervisor.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally submitted my project report earlier this month, but my report is literally a pile of shit, I was panicking after submission and sent an email to him:

*""Hi, \*supervisor name\*,*

*I regret to tell you that the project report I submitted is incomplete in many sections including references and I do realize how this might be  upsetting for you.* 

*It is still important for me to pass my project, perhaps I can provide an  updated report before a potential Viva? I understand this might not be  possible, but I just really don’t know what to do right now. I would appreciate it if we could have a meeting  regarding what I can do and the likely outcome of my project, I can also  offer explanations if it is something you need to know.""*    
 

&amp;#x200B;

My supervisor replied my email 5 days later, with my email above forwarded to the postgraduate office:

*""Sorry for the delay in replying – I have asked \*lady who works at PG office\* about this and we have to accept your first submission for now.* 

*The  best thing to do now is to prepare your presentation for the viva – we  can meet for me to give you some advice about this if you want. I don’t  have confirmation yet when the viva will be but I think it will be Wednesday 22. ""*

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately replied 20 minutes later with:

*""Hi \*supervisor name\*,*

*Yes  it would be be helpful if you could give me some advice on the  presentation. For now I will focus on making up for the missing  discussion and conclusion sessions in my report through the  presentation, but not sure what else I should I include.*

*I will available the rest of the week from today.""*

&amp;#x200B;

He didn't reply, I thought he probably didn't want to deal with me anymore, so second day early morning I followed up a email with:

*""Hi \*supervisor name\*,*

*Don't  worry about the meeting now, I think I have a good idea of what to do  for the presentation and will just prepare accordingly.*

*Regards""*

&amp;#x200B;

He never replied me after that, and I was getting advice from PG office regarding my situation. The lady had even addressed that first email I sent to my supervisor. 

 *""I can confirm that  we accepted the file that you submitted 25 minutes late (attached) and  this file has been passed onto the examiners for marking. Is this the file you were referring to in your email to \*my supervisor\*  on the 8th September""*

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's making me feel like it was very wrong of me to have sent a email like that, like I was trying to get my supervisor to give me better marks without the university knowing. That wasn't what I was trying to do, my supervisor would be the reader of my report so I thought it would be best to consult him first. That email is somewhat or maybe even outright inappropriate, I undertstand. I was panicking and was just thinking he would just simply say no instead of passing my email to other parties. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to submit another mitigating circumstances claim, so I'm not really panicking now. But the past days I've just been thinking whether I should applosize to and also clarify my intent when sending that email with my supervisor and the PG office.

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe I'm just overthinking? I really don't know anymore, I couldn't perform well and I might fail my degree, that's already enough to deal with for myself. I never expected to have constantly worry about upsetting other people because I couldn't finish MY degree.",academia,1631986842

I tried to keep them into the loop by sending them regular emails to have them review my progress which they said they would but many times I would not hear anything back. I continued anyways.

It was also my job to find the journals to submit to, edit the papers to their liking, basically do everything. Which I did. 

At one point we got acceptance into a decent journal and all they required was a fee which was emailed to both of us early on and of which we both agreed we would pay. By the time we reached this point, this coauthor decided not to pay and left me and the journal in an awkward position. I tried negotiating with them, but they stopped responding. I felt humiliated and had to withdraw the paper. 

I decided to give them another chance and let them know that I will try elsewhere and would appreciate some help from their side. So far, no answer. I am thinking of going ahead and completing all these projects by myself and removing their name because they honestly are doing absolutely nothing and I still feel horrible about the instance with the last journal.

I am a 2nd year undergrad in my early 20s. I have fairly bad anxiety working against me, but it's something that also lends itself to my efforts to be a good student. I keep my camera on during classes, contribute where I can even if I'm not sure about my answer (...anxiety), etc. 

This semester, I am enrolled in a more senior-level course. This was enough to spark my imposter syndrome... I don't think I'm that great at writing and it freaks me out to be surrounded by students with more experience (I imagine). 

What I know is this: there are students who don't do the readings, who do not contribute, and to some extent that is enough to tell myself I belong. I can learn and do better as long as I put in the effort.

The problem is that I find that there will occasionally be a student who is out for blood. They play the ""devil's advocate"" - eager to argue - and speak profoundly for far too long. Yes, I can give credit where it's due: they're intellectual, but aggressively so. And it's also kind of snooty to approach class discussion like a research paper when clearly not everyone is that experienced, but I digress. My approach with my peers is: this is what I think, I'm interested to hear what you have to offer. I don't talk the whole time, I encourage the silent people to speak up, and if I disagree with anything said I don't fight it because I only care about my understanding of the course adjacent to how it is being taught. I'm not being tested on opinions, and when we are graded for them, the creativity of my major offers flexibility.

I believe it can be healthy to challenge others to look at things from a different perspective, but they have to be open to it and you have to make sure they're comfortable with that. Or, at the very least, why not take it up delicately? 

I can't handle this sort of confrontation without taking it personally. I know that that is part of higher education, but I didn't sign up here to be *argued with*. I am here to learn in a supportive, encouraging environment. I don't need hand-holding, but I don't want conversations that aren't productive. Even the prof is gentle, saying there are aspects of readings she didn't understand at first, dumbing things down a little, or telling us ""there's no right answer"" when prompting for different perspectives.

How do I move on from this?! It's a frustrating situation that causes me to stress so much. I have to sit in class with this person 2x a week for the rest of the semester, probably work with her again, and as I mentioned I've already come across people like this before. 

(The cherry on top: I don't even think I was that wrong. It's hard to explain out of context, but I admitted my narrow perspective on the subject, said what I thought (expecting others to just contribute after that) but instead received ""I have to challenge you on that,"" and wasted 5 minutes being asked questions that seemed designed to trip me up.

However, I regret my decision. I just am not good at what I do. It takes so much time to implement equations from the literature to my work. I still can't fully understand many things about my research which should have been second nature by now.

I enjoy my research. But I am just not capable of doing this as a profession. I am getting rejections from people and industry I want to work with. I am 32 and still a postdoc with my PhD advisor (Started March 2020), which was supposed to be a temporary arrangement before covid.

I am just not feeling motivated to work anymore. I feel I am just wasting my life by being ambitious when I don't have what it takes to be successful in my field or in research. Is it too late now to address it?",academia,1631697410

1,Getting so tired,"Hi folks, I'm looking for a bit of advice from early career acedemics (postdocs and early career professors). I'm so fucking tired. Currently working on getting two papers from my current postdoc out (about 8 months in), two papers from my PhD, and a grant application for a new postdoc position (current postdoc is a year with potential for extension). It's so much fucking work. I feel like I'm not over the end of my PhD as it was a very bad situation with a toxic advisor during the pandemic when you don't get to see anyone. I've got so much writing to do and I can't seem to get ahead of it. I'm not the fastest writer and tend to tinker with manuscripts (hold over from a toxic advisor). How do you cope with it all? It's been hard as fuck to keep everything together without spiraling into substance abuse. I love doing science and the research I'm doing is really cool, I just can't deal with the bureaucracy of it all. It seems to become less about doing amazing Science and more dealing with the bureaucracy of reviewers and coauthors who don't really give a shit about the science that's being done. Half of them gatekeep to keep to push out manuscripts that are actually a good fit for journals. Sorry for the rant, I'm just kind of done. I don't understand how everyone seems to handle everything so eloquently, I feel like I'm drowning. Any advice is appreciated.",academia,1631678943

&amp;#x200B;

For example in my case, I need to find out almost 1 to 3 students of official master's degree in cognitive science students via some international universities, to teach me or my friends during their semester, by re-teaching their lessons as an educational team works.

&amp;#x200B;

This procedure could be done through software such as Zoom or Skype, and I could document the entire process of education by recording the meetings and uploading them on the internet (based on the student permission) and also could help them via doing their exercises or ... 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, For documenting the entire procedure, I could create some post via the weblog sites via my [medium](https://elasa2next.medium.com/), [virgool](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fa&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://virgool.io/@soheil_sa) or [GitHub](https://github.com/So-AI-love/academic-courses-Pattern-Recognition) page.

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Which proposed mechanisms can be used for finding the access to the academic courses like [Scott H](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/) [done here](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/) to find some students interested in offering semester courses to interested people (who are not members of the university system) to re-teach us these courses by themselves?

&amp;#x200B;

If possible, I like to have some comment or answer about other's available supportive system which could be used to find out more access to the available educational mechanisms for this purpose. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, As you know this question could be used for showing some pattern which could be done for other students are interested in accessing the content and communication available in the university classrooms, which for some reason, such as financial problems or ... have not been able to enroll in the classes.

17,Is it worth it to work without pay?,"So I’ve been reaching out to all of my professors during undergrad, I wanted to get research experience or internships and was ok with them not paying me. 
But no one accepted. In my country colleges are all about taking courses and passing the tests and have a ridiculously high GPA. But if I wanted to go abroad I need the research experience. 

So after about a full year (May2021) of my graduation one professor reached out to me and asked if I’m willing to participate (unpaid, but she MIGHT add my name to the publication). So I accepted, I was a part time intern and the commute from my internship to the university was very convenient. She told me that she’d get back to me, but she didn’t, until now. 

She called and asked me to come tomorrow for half an hour, I don’t want to pay for a cab and I don’t own a car, so I asked if they’d at least compensate me for transportation. I know that they recently got a very good grant so they can pay me. 
After that she got furious and said that I should be prepared for anything since I’ve reached out to her and not the other way around, and that I shouldn’t care for money if I wanna get into grad school I have to work without pay… with all that being said she assembled a team of 6 master students and me, we all won’t get paid, but the master students live at or near the university and all of them get a student’s stipend so money isn’t an issue to them.

23,Etiquette for Sending Scholars My Book for Free vs Charging?,"I'm in the humanities, publishing a book that will be of interest to a few senior scholars and specialists in my field. It makes sense to me to make them aware that the book exists both to establish myself in the field and so that the word spreads faster. I've been in touch with some of these people before and they know about my work, but will be reaching out to a few specialists I've never corresponded with before. I'm wondering what the etiquette is for distributing my book to them versus the alternative, for example, of making them aware it exists and hoping they or their library will get it. 

My book is in an academic series, and so costs about $150, but of course I don't get a penny of that. Still, it's good when it sells copies. I have a PDF of the final book of course. 

Should I write to them and mention that my book engages with their work and simply attach a PDF copy? Should I write them the same email and say, if they're interested, I could get them a PDF? Should I offer a PDF and offer a hard copy if they agree to review it? Or should I go some other route and tell them to buy the book or ask if their library would acquire it? The last option would feel like pressing the self-promotion a bit too far, but then again, giving away my book for free to senior scholars who could afford it also doesn't feel that great.

24,Would an online master program help me enroled in a Phd program?What is the easiest way to get a PhD,"So I will be honest here. I did want to be a scientist when I grew up. It is not, you know, some cliched opening line in a personal statement. It is true. My one goal when I was a child is to be a scientist, and I went to a pretty good  World Top 30 Universities in Canada studying Physics. Unfotunately, for various reasons,  I had a nervous breakdown. I know it is frowned upon as being ""unsophisticated"" to self-diagnose, but I am pretty sure I developed serious syndrom of depression and bipolar disorder. Alas, I was too depressed even to seek help. I locked myself in my dormitory and refused to talk to anybody. Eventually, I dropped out. 

I went back to my home country and did various low-skill low-paid jobs etc. In the meantime, I managed to complete an undergraduate degree from those open universities in my country.  Recently,  while I was browsing through Coursera, I was intrigued by those online master degree offered there. [like this](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/3016299490513/WN_3bIDtRNtTd6si0UZXXKCpg) It definitely wasn't cheap, and it wasn't recogonized by my home country, although I believe it is recogonized as a proper master by WES and other countries. My question, to PhD advisors out there, is this:would these online master be helpful for me to acquire a Phd? 

Why do I want a Phd? 

Partly because I am a shallow person and I would like a Phd to boost my poor self-esteem.

Partly because I felt I owed it to my young self to at least partially fulfill my childhood dream and somewhat contribute to the collective knowledge of humanity, no matter how insignificant it is.

But mostly, because the immigration process to Canada is pretty elitist and I came to the conclusion that I really no longer want to live in my home country anymore. Various other countries have pretty welcoming policy for Phd holder that are not available for people with lessser degrees. 

I know I would probabbly never be a professor and live the life of a true academia. I missed my boat and that's it. I am already approaching 30s. And I would be approaching 40s if I do complete a PhD. and I don't how serious age descrimination is but I heard at least in the West it is not as serious as in my home country. So hopefully I would be able to find a job. But regardless, I don't even mind cleaning floors or washing dishes if that means I could get to at least give my child a chance to live in a normal country where I don't have to use VPN to post questions on Reddit. 

I have left the academia for so long and I am not sure how it works anymore. And obviously, I know it differs from field to field. I would be interested in a field like AI or Computer Science but if these are too hot for me to compete in, I don't mind a different field. 

I obviously would prefer to go back to Canada for my PhD program, but if that is too unrealistic, I don't mind a PhD position from some less well-known Universities in developing countries. I heard Russia has a pretty low bar of entry for PhD candidates? Currently I speak English, Mandarin, Cantonese and French. I don't mind studying another languages since I am always interested to learn a new language. 

Please don't say stuff like ""this is not a good reason to have a PhD etc. "" I know it's not. But we don't live in an ideal world .",academia,1631536643

46,To stay or not to stay,"Hi all! 

I'm in the process of having to decide if I want to leave my PhD program or stick it out. I'm not gonna explain my whole situation here (it's explained in my most recent post, if you want to understand). To put it shortly, my program is no longer what I initially came here for. The ultimate goal was to graduate and enter academia (there is an extreme demand for my subject, so this would be no struggle, unlike most PhDs/subjects). I could stick it out and get those positions immediately after grad, or I can leave and take a position teaching at the community college level or at lesser known, smaller institutions. I have my MS from a prestigious university that I can use for those positions, and I do have some experience. My #1 priority and passion is teaching, not research. If I never did research again, I would be perfectly fine. Which is why I'm wondering if those higher level teaching positions are even worth it in the first place, because they would mostly, if not all, require me to do research. Positions at lesser known institutions and cc don't seem to have as much of a desire for research. BUT the pay is much lower as well, which is important to remember.

My question here is this: for those who do teach at community colleges or smaller, lesser known 4-year institutions, how are you feeling about your job? Do you enjoy your job? How is your work/life balance, and do you ever wish you could advance to the professional/graduate/well known 4 year institutional level? If you are teaching with a masters, do you feel that you get pushed to the side/walked on by those with PhDs?

This is a huge decision, and I've got a lot to think about, but I don't know anyone personally who teaches at these levels. I have no one else to ask, so I'm looking for perspective. I would love to hear about your experiences!",academia,1631289052

There is this advisor that I am interested to work with. The field is biomedical engineering. However, looking at past student theses in last 10 years (5 or more students), each of which took a long time to graduate (phd theses date - bs/ms date). Almost all are 7-8 years or more, 2 took 10 years to graduate.

I've talked to the professor, and he admitted ""It was a disaster"" because he let them choose their own topics. They experimented with it and sometimes it didn't work out, or they took 4 years to come up with a topic. So with future PhD students he will be more strict and give them topics where they can graduate on time, or have them jump onto ongoing projects so they don't have to start the animal training from scratch, which takes a long time. I would say his style is very hands off, non-pushy type in general.

I just have doubt in my mind, can I take his word for it? Is this something that can be changed i.e. even though he says he will give a tight control over the projects I do, but maybe over course of 5 years he reverts back to his old style. Appreciate any advice and wisdom.",academia,1631261851

53,How Implausible is it to Create a Legitimate New Field of Study With Higher-Learning Degrees?,"Hey everyone. 

Going to cut straight to the point. I'm a researcher in the blockchain space. If you read that last sentence with a smirk / suppressed chuckle, then congratulations - you're highly in-tune with the motivating factor behind the creation of this post. 

Its no secret that blockchain &amp; Bitcoin are generally not taken that seriously in the world at large. A big reason for that (in  my opinion), is a lack of serious, academic rigor + foundation to underpin the industry. Due to the absence of academia in blockchain, its hard to qualify any particular piece of published research as ""legitimate"" in an objective manner (or as objective as one could hope to be). 

Usually, industries benefit from there being a 'guard' or established texts / literature that define X from Y &amp; explain certain concepts (to some extent). However, that doesn't exist in blockchain (yet). I'm certain that there are some programs that exist at certain institutions sporadically, but its far from a vocation at this point. 

So I've come to ask you all the absurd, mammoth question of...'How would one go about formalizing ""blockchain"" as a field of research worthy of the same consideration that other long-standing disciplines have?' 

Specifically, I'm referring to: 

- PhD programs 

- Undergraduate Major 

- Master's Course 

- Outlining / Shelling out sub-disciplines underneath the greater 'umbrella' 

Please let me know if my questions is too vague and/or whimsical. This is being asked by someone with little to no credible experience in academia (beyond what you'd expect of your typical college grad). I have relatives with graduate degrees &amp; am familiar with a significant # of individuals (of all ages / from all eras), that have completed the PhD / Master's journey. So that part (with advisors / research questions / etc.), is not totally unfamiliar. 

So feel free to lay it on thick with the 'jargon' in your responses and thank you in advance for all those that have taken the time to read this post &amp; provide a legitimate answer. You're forever appreciated &amp; I am ultimately humbled to be blessed with whatever knowledge you care to bestow upon me today. 

Thank you.",academia,1631225058

64,Second degree for the dream of being an academician,"

Hello r/askacademia,
I am graduated from an International Relations bachelor degree. I actually graduated with 3,6 GPA and was thinking about being an academician in the field but while I searched for master degree opportunities, I realized I am not passionate enough in the field to become an academician. In high school, I actually dreamt about studying literature (english literature and/or comparative literature) but I thought I would be jobless and I had no vision to predict that I would become an academician since I didn't know I can make good grades in college. Now I am 24 and thinking about going for an second degree. I will try to apply to masters for comparative literature but I don't know if I will be admitted. But if I will start to college again, I know I will be successful since I am deeply passionate about literature. And now at least I have my more 'job-secured' diploma in IR if things don't go well.

So, what do you think? Do you think this is an reasonable thought to start college again  at 25 (after 1 year preperation for national entrance exam)?",academia,1631131400

I'm a 24 year old woman just about to start the second year of my PhD at a UK university. For the past four months, I've been dating one of the postdocs in my department. He's 30, male, just about to start the second year of a 3-year postdoc. We seem perfectly matched and I really like him. We haven't really made our relationship common knowledge because we're both very private people, but neither of us have thought anything is wrong with it.

But today one of my fellow PhDs found out about it and she's been giving me a really hard time all day. ""You could get in so much trouble"", ""He's abusing his position you know"", ""Staff shouldn't date students"". I know it's a bit of a grey area but people are largely against staff dating students, I get it - but at the same time, it's not like he's a senior professor or anything. I can't find anything in the uni rules that would actually forbid it, and I knew him before I started my PhD anyway, while he was still doing his.

I just wondered what people thought. Is this a relationship that would be really frowned upon? Or is my friend just kicking up a fuss over nothing. I don't feel we've done anything wrong but I am a little worried of others finding out now 😧

Are we in a 'post or perish' era?,"There are people at my university, from PhD to tenured professors that constantly self-promote. When I say constantly, I mean daily or 3-4 times a week. 

Their social media is their self-promotion platform, and it's all fine and good if they want to do it, I suppose, and it's a way of keeping in touch and disseminating your research, but man does it get exhausting. The things that I find annoying is when the posts aren't really about the content of their research at all but about them (for example, I know my colleague is 'immensely honoured and proud to announce that he is organising a session at the xyz conference' but he doesn't tells us what his session is about. Stuff like that.) 

I just mute and hide them when it gets too much, but I see that more and more of my colleagues are aggressively self-promoting via social media and I'm wondering if it's becoming this thing that we are all supposed to do.

I also find it exhausting because it's work itself: the posting, engaging and content creation. It's like you now also have to be your own unpaid social media manager. I guess the thing that is making me upset is whether this is now expected of scholars? Because I don't want to do it. There is 'publish of perish' and now there is 'post or perish'.

I was thinking to apply for another PhD in the US, firstly because I always wanted to move over the Atlantic, secondly because I like how American PhD is structured in comparison to Italian PhD.
But I have a few questions:

I know it's not advisable to do a second PhD in the same (or related) field (e.g. I'm interested in aesthetic and philosophy of music, so I could look also for a doctorate in music theory of art theory) but is it even allowed to do that?

Will I considered a low-profile if I have two PhDs?

I really want to do research but now I'm out of the market, no network and no support by any institution.

I feel like I need to start again and do it better.",academia,1630884044
98,IWTL how to be grateful for getting into grad school,"I know in a way, this post does not belong here but I do not have enough karma to post in r/Iwanttolearn

I (21M) graduated from my undergraduate studies last year and got to serve a year as a teaching assistant at my department as part of mandatory national service for all tertiary graduates in my country, Ghana. 
Mostly, all TAs want to further their studies, preferably on a scholarship abroad. I was lucky enough to get into a program at a Canadian university in May. None of my colleagues from my department and people I know who wanted to further their studies abroad got the opportunity I have. Unfortunately, my study permit got refused but fortunately because of COVID, I get the chance to do the program online. I know I should be happy but the study permit refusal keeps messing with my mind and I feel like it will affect my studies negatively. Studies start next week. I am also anxious about studies because it is quite different from the kind I am used to in Ghana.
Side note, I applied to some German universities too and I have an interview with one of the schools I applied to next week for admission. 

With all this, I feel like I should be grateful and happy because I have taken significant steps towards my goal but I'm quite miserable and sad. I have mania episodes every now and then, where I get motivated and optimistic but it drain away pretty fast.

TL;DR, I am not happy nd grateful even though I am making remarkable steps towards my goal in life.",academia,1630879874

I think I messed up big please help - 

Back in my undergrad I did a research project using observational data from a location in 2017. That project has since been published in a graduate journal in 2019 as, let's say, *Title X*.

The issue is, in 2018 (before the project was published) I collected data at the same location again and made a research presentation on the same topic with a different title, *Title Y*, and forgot about it. It's now on a website permanently. 

There is some analysis that is different between the two works, but they also share a lot of the same analysis of the data. But, they don't have citations/references about each other - is this a really big issue like plagiarism? I don't think I will go into academia as a profession, but I just realized this could be bad and am freaking out.

Please let me know your thoughts - will anyone really find out or care about this? And what could I do to fix it - like should I add a citation/reference about the publication in the research presentation? (This may or may not be possible).

But due to the pandemic I was not able to finish it. I really enjoyed the work I did and was curious to know what would happen if I continued. 

Now in my MSc, my professor asked me if I wanted to continue the same project looking at how curious and enthusiastic I was. And I said yes. 

He basically changed the title extending my research from just zebrafish to cell line and other animal models. 

I wish to do my PhD. But I don't not want to continue my research on the same topic. My interests are vague but I'm quite sure I want to get into gene editing and molecular biology. 

Now, my worry is;

1) Would I have had better opportunities for a PhD program if I had exposure to two different topics? 

2) Will having two projects on the same topic hinder my chances of venturing into different ones for a PhD?

13,Question for those on search committees about a retired reference,"I’m getting ready to start applying for jobs starting Fall ‘22, mostly tenure track (STEM) at smaller sized 4 year Undergrad/Small graduate program schools. Much higher teaching loads than research.

I have an excellent reference for teaching. I taught about 7 sections of an introductory course per year for 6 years as an adjunct at a community college before going back to get my PhD. The dean of the STEM department where I taught liked me a lot, and has written a very strongly worded reference letter.

However, she retired in 2017. I have still been planning on using her for a reference, she still has an email address at the college because she has been teaching as an adjunct since she retired. But she is going to stop teaching there after the fall semester this year, and doesn’t think she will still have a reliable email address there by January.

I’m wondering how it will look to search committees if I use her, with only a phone number and Gmail address. I feel like it might look a bit suspect, with no way to confirm it is really her. I suppose they could look her picture up online and ask her to video chat if they wanted, but that seems complicated.

Does anyone with exp in reviewing for job searches have any opinions on whether I should go with something different? She is by far the best reference I have for teaching, and most of the positions I will be applying to are going to be more teaching heavy. I have 2 good references for research (more really) but the only other reference I have for teaching is a tenured professor at the same community college I taught at.

I have 3 choices, assuming standard applications usually ask for 3 references.

1 Use my former dean, and 2 research references
2 Use the tenured professor I worked with and 2 research references
3 Use both teaching references and just my doctoral PI for research.
I really want to use my dean, as she had supervisory authority over me. The other tenured professor did not, basically just a coworker. Both of them would write very good recommendations. Im mostly just curious which option might be better, and whether it looks suspect using a reference with no contact information directly tied into the school?",academia,1630703155

16,Taking a Humanities Job at an Elite University in the Middle of Nowhere ...or not?,"The job would be at a famous New England SLAC. As I think everyone knows, the humanities job market went from bad to worse to we didn't think it could get *this* bad. I think a lot of people in the humanities would think they struck the jackpot to get this job, and the job itself would indeed be pretty cushy as far as tenure-track humanities jobs go ... but it's a school famously in the middle of nowhere in a town with a population of a few thousand, the weather there is famously bad, I'm single, and very prone to loneliness and depression. For students at the university, making friends and the dating pool isn't a problem, but I could not imagine being single in a tiny New England hamlet. The nearest major city is more than a three hours drive away. 

I have been bouncing around post-docs and there is a good chance I can win another major grant that would let me live wherever I want for the next 3-6 years, but obviously it's not the golden tenure-track ticket. I feel like it would be idiotic to turn down the job (the offer hasn't been made either), but I'm wondering if anyone has experience in this kind of situation or advice to offer.

27,Should I confess my obsessive infatuation with my professor?,"I don't want to go into too much detail, but I graduated college in May. There was a professor who I was very close with before the pandemic. We met once after the pandemic(she emailed me wanting to meet after I graduated in May) and I felt like it was a super awkward meeting because I had realized these feelings but felt too scared to say anything(mainly because she has a husband and I am 99% certain she would reject me and likely lose professional respect for me).

I wanted to just forget it, but the last few months I just haven't been able to let the thought of her go. I do think the Covid stress and all is making it worse, I also started working full-time, started meds for adhd, and other stressful things. I miss her and want to see her. 

She used to tell me I was special and had a “unique mind” and other nice comments. Like I want to ask her if she says these things to everyone, or if she actually thinks I’m somehow special, and how? And if she thinks I’m special in a similar way to how I find her special maybe we can be in love? I took a class on the nature of love with her and I used to imagine that she was referencing herself and saying that she wanted to be loved in some way that she wasn’t currently being loved(looking back this was very narcisstic. The whole thing feels so narcissistic, like I can’t give up the idea that she might think of me as irrationally highly as I do of her. In reality I spend hours thinking about her while she doesn’t think about me and it’s hard for me to accept). 

I’m afraid of her reacting badly. I’m almost sure she’d reject me, but if she did it nicely and just explained to be that she, indeed, loves her husband and isn’t in an unhappy marriage, or that she simply isn’t attracted to me in that way—that would be good, I think that would be helpful and cathartic. But I’m afraid she will think I’m insane for thinking about it so much and get creeped out, and gossip to the other professors, including her husband(who I also respect which complicated things even more). I want to go to graduate school after I get my mental health together more(in the next few years) and don’t want to “burn a bridge” possibly with the entire department thinking I’m crazy.

It’s weird being in a situation like this as an adult...like if I was 16 and crushing on my teacher, I bet she’d almost certainly not take it seriously and just be nice about it. But I feel like maybe she’ll blame me for being a coward(by not saying anything and letting it fester like this). I have gone to bars, tinder, tried dating other girls but I can’t let go of this attachment.

I talked to my two best friends and one thinks I should just tell her and get it over with while the other thinks it’s worth me doing what I can to just move on to avoid the trauma it might cause me. What do y’all think?",academia,1630586745
28,Lack of community/solidarity in academia,"First of all, apologies for another rant about academia that is going to come and hopefully you'll bear with me for a moment.

I work as a postdoc in the natural sciences at a research institute in Germany. This is my first postdoc after finishing my PhD in another country. I'm in my late twenties, male, an EU citizen, but am not white/European.

The work is challenging and interesting, but the environment and people are putting me down. Basically, there is no sense of community in my group and department, and everyone seems to mind their own business. We don't have coffee breaks or lunches together and people hardly greet each other in the corridor.

My understanding is that this is somewhat inherent to the nature of academic work. Unless you directly collaborate with your colleagues (which I hardly do), everyone has different projects and there is often no real need to interact professionally. There are group meetings, but usually people fall to sleep when other start presenting their work that has nothing to do with their own.

This is perhaps aggravated by the fact that I am in a very diverse group, where everyone comes from a different country and sometimes academic background. As a result, there's considerable segregation by country/language. People rather interact with colleagues from different groups that come from the same country / speak their native language, than with their direct colleagues in the same group. There's nobody else from my country in my department.

I'm tired of having lunch alone every day and spending the rest of the day in my private office (however luxurious this might seem). I'm not expecting to be best friends with my colleagues, but this extremely closed attitude of others also makes me less willing to step up to others.

Of course, you might suggest that I should take more initiative myself, and are correct about this. I have made a few steps, from offering free ice cream to going climbing with colleagues. However, these actions are not truly reciprocated. 

The bigger picture question is whether this is somewhat inherent to academia or not. I suppose that in many companies in industry, there's more focus on teamwork, and you are naturally forced to work closely with a few others. The question is whether this naturally leads to more social behavior or not?

I’m lucky to have found a job at one of the top research universities in the US. I’m realizing I stumbled into a really fantastic position. My PIs are the top of their field and better yet, they are incredibly nice and willing to engage with me personally. 

Thoughts of a PhD had crossed my mind before, but my masters degree is in a field known for its low pay/low respect and I thought a PhD would be a waste of time. I’m also really bad at the quantitative side of things. I hated statistics so much in both undergrad and grad school. 

Now that I’m in this adjacent field, I could see it and I want it. I enjoy asking questions and digging into problems. I’ve found that I really enjoy the process of designing studies and writing/presenting findings. I like the idea of teaching but could be just as happy doing qualitative research in this field. I don’t love the bureaucracy of the thing and I don’t see myself doing the kind of work I’m currently doing (essentially study coordination) forever.

Briefly, they have a history of students dropping out or transferring out of their lab (2 transferred, 5 dropped and 5 graduated in the last 11 years), they force their students to work half time or more on unrelated research projects while teaching half time and doing their own research during long semesters because we “owe them” for supporting us during the summer, they expect us to answer texts and phone calls between 10pm and midnight on a regular basis, we have been told not to email them and text instead because “their email is a mess”, they retaliated against their masters student who expressed concern for analyzing (combusting) samples on lab equipment that was not functioning (they claimed it was and the student was just nervous but have since put in a work order for the part of the machine that was in question confirming that it was truly broken) which included verbally abusing the student in front of a failed “mediator” who expressed at the beginning of the meeting that they would be a “neutral observer” (this student dropped out one month shy of graduating because of the ongoing abuse), they talk negatively about other graduate students and faculty in the department and openly threaten to not work with them if they won’t do as asked (including new TT faculty who they mentor), and they force their graduate TAs to act as a lab coordinator for their lab courses (e.g. making the syllabus, creating and modifying course content, creating keys for lab and lecture assignments and all grading) to the point where they have no involvement in their own courses. 

Students in this lab have shared their experiences with other faculty in the department, so this is not a secret. The department chair is very close to the professor I’m describing (who is also the assistant department chair) and will not support students that come forward (the department chair actively sabotaged the masters student’s attempt to switch advisors which is why they ultimately dropped out). Myself and others have spoken with the assistant Dean of students and were told that nothing can be done unless the professors actions clearly violate Title IX. 

I recently finished my degree requirements (I will technically graduate in December) and barely finished - I had to start taking medication six months ago to help with daily anxiety attacks that were affecting my ability to work and spent $500 on doctors visits to confirm I was having stress-induced arrhythmia. Now that I am not directly relying on my advisor for anything (I still have to publish my dissertation chapters but my degree requirements are completed and they badly need my publications for their promotional package for full professor) I want to be able to share my experiences without fear of retaliation so that it is public knowledge that this person is awful to work for (unless you are a white male in which case you’ll be fine) and to help my lab mates that are still there and suffering. However I don’t know what else I can do - if the department and college won’t take action what is left?

I spent a whole week researching the lab group and preparing for my interview, but I'm not that great in interviews in the first place... I don't do well under pressure or when I'm nervous! It also doesn't help that so many of these postdocs have requirements that I don't think one single person can every meet, so I never know how to address it when they ask if I have experience with a particular method or software I've never used.

Any tips, advice, reassuring comments would be much appreciated. I'm not sure I can survive the whole process again, sigh. Just complaining here, really, haha.",academia,1630467600
39,Supervisor forgot to reserve my TAship. How should i respond to my supervisor?,"Im starting a masters this fall. When i was admitted, my supervisor said he reserved a TAship. This was because i kept asking him about entrance funding but the funding was mostly drained due to COVID. So it seemed like a TAship was all my uni could offer. The TAship was only for the fall semester 100 hours at $27.60 an hour. But he said if i did well i could keep TAing the course and work up to 20 hours per week. I didnt receive any messages from my supervisor or anyone else about the course im supposed to TA for. I checked midsummer and my supervisor said i didnt need to do anything to prep for it. Checked again this week and he forgot about my TAship and now he is saying to get a TAship i need to formally apply for it. Im not sure how to respond to my supervisor. Im really frustrated about this, especially because my budget was based off this TAship. Im moving to a new city where i dont speak the language so finding a different job would be very hard. Any thoughts on how i should reply? Thanks",academia,1630420324

1. Bioinformatics based- Multidisciplinary project where I have a chance to do epigenetic statistics + apply my data to cell culture. The supervisors seem really professional and seem to be very confident in this project. 
2. Cell mechanobiology + cancer biology - This is a project which is a mix on biomedical engineering, cell culture and intravital imaging. The supervisors seem really friendly and honest and have given me a lot of good advice for ex. making sure I talk to grad students without a supervisor present to get to know the lab atmosphere. The only downside is that we are still waiting on a grant outcome for this project. 

Both projects are flexible according to my interests but that shouldn't be a problem as I really like both of them. Also, all the supervisors have great track records. I guess this is more of a which field is better for career prospects in academia or industry choice.

49,Can I hire a grad student or professor as an editor/ghostwriter?,"I dropped out of my PhD program ABD in order to go into industry about 6 years ago.  Nonetheless, I've continued doing research in various topics that interest me both in and out of my field.

Long story short I've done some experiments and got some really good results on a long standing problem.  I did an extensive literature review and I'm confident I have a novel result.

The problem is that I'm a computer scientist and this result is in pure math (algebra and dynamic systems).  So I'm not familiar with the terminology and writing style that would be expected in that field or the correct way to phrase my results that would be the most compelling.

I also don't know what details of the results would be considered extraneous versus what would need to be given a detailed explanation.  

Etc.  Basically lots of structure and editorial and vocabulary questions to make the paper the most compelling.

When I was in academia this would be the job of my advisor, but I don't have an advisor.

Additionally, I'd like to avoid giving someone a coauthorship to do this job.  I'm not arrogant, but considering that all the results and experiments and proofs and hard science work were done by me, I don't necessarily want to share credit with someone who is helping me mostly with the writing. 

 In my old lab that would be expected, but it was done in the context/understanding that if I gave them a coauthership for editorial help now, we were all in the same lab so they'd give me credit later when I did the same for them.  But in this case there's no such reciprocal relationship if I looped in a random person.

Additionally, I strongly fear that since I am outside of the relevant field and no longer an academic and not a PhD, if I give a ""real"" researcher an authorship credit then it will be naturally assumed that they were the source of the real research contribution and results and they will be the ones most consulted about it and credited with the results, simply because it is more believable than an insider did the research versus a layperson.

Is it ethical to pay a researcher to do this editing and rewriting and presentation work with me without giving them a co-author credit?  If so, how do I do that?  If not, what would you guys recommend I do?",academia,1630363907

62,Uncredited co-authorship in a social sciences book chapter,"I wanted to share my experience of not being acknowledged and listed as a co-author in a book chapter that included significant intellectual contribution of mine. I know this topic comes up often here, but I hope it’s ok to share my experience too.

I worked with a senior Chilean researcher on a book chapter on China-Chile economic relations, nothing groundbreaking or particularly insightful, just a typical overview, identification of challenges, and ideas for what to do next. We agreed at first that my contribution would consist of *assisting* her in the section on China’s cooperation policy. She’s an economist and has limited knowledge of international politics, while I’m a PhD student in that very field here in China (though I’m also Latin American). 

Turns out that I wrote that entire section (1/3 of the chapter). While I had some very general guidelines from her, I was the one who gathered and analyzed the data. Most of the preconceived notions she had in her research proposal were off and I changed them according to proper evidence and rigorous analysis (as opposed to repeating what you hear on the news, as she did). Additionally, I contributed to designing the outline of the entire chapter, wrote a draft for the introduction and conclusion, and provided a series of observations regarding the content she wrote for the other two sections (including correcting other unfounded arguments).

Based on guidelines from [APA](https://www.apa.org/research/responsible/publication#:~:text=authorship%20credit%20should%20reflect%20the%20individual's%20contribution%20to%20the%20study), [Harvard](https://research.fas.harvard.edu/links/guidelines-authorship-and-acknowledgement#:~:text=CPC).-,Criteria,authorship%20is%20not%20inappropriately%20assigned.,-Acknowledgment%20Versus), and [Yale](https://provost.yale.edu/policies/academic-integrity/guidance-authorship-scholarly-or-scientific-publications#:~:text=requirement%20for%20attribution%20of%20authorship), I felt my contribution was proper of a coauthor and asked her (nicely) to consider it as such, but she said no. She argued that I was just writing according to her instructions and that we had agreed at the beginning my contribution was going to be regarded as support work, and be noted in the acknowledgments. I have deep respect and appreciation for her, as I worked as her research assistant for a couple of years (in Chile), but I feel this is unfair and unethical. She has done this before to others and even to myself, though this time was particularly bad. 

Even though in social sciences single-authored works are probably still the norm, there are quite a lot of publications with 2-3 authors. I believe universities (and scholars themselves) should be more aware of this issue of professors not properly acknowledging the work of their assistants. I’ve talked to some colleagues about this kind of issue and I think it’s relatively common.

In my case specifically, she’s already helped me a lot and I don’t want to burn any bridges, so I definitely won’t pursue any actions against her. I’ll just politely say that, in the future, I’d like to work only on projects that I’ll be listed as an author/co-author.",academia,1630244189

25,PhD Dissertation to Book?,"TL;DR: If your PhD is not ready to be published is it your failure or a normal situation?

  
I am finally submitting my PhD dissertation on Monday. I am an historian and my research took me about six years to complete. Because of the time spent in travelling, looking for grants, et.c I ended up writing the whole dissertation in 4 months. My supervisor suggested only minor corrections. But I am not satisfied with the final result.

As my research topic is quite interesting and previously unexplored, I would like to turn it into a book. But there some problems. I have an extensive introduction which would be needless outside the context of a dissertation, my narration needs to be improved and new material needs to be included.  


So, I would be curious to read other people's experience. Should your dissertation be ready to come out as a book or it takes time and effort in order t reach that point?

34,CFP — Censorship Conference (abstracts due Sept. 7),"**Obscenity! Blasphemy! Treason!**

**An Interdisciplinary International Conference on Censorship**

**March 3–4, 2022 at NTU and online**  
   
**Keynote: Ramona Naddaff (UC Berkeley)**

**CFP deadline: September 7, 2021**

Obscenity! Blasphemy! Treason! Justifications for censorship imply that censored objects hold the power to subvert moral, religious, and civic good. The censor assumes that power, turning the censored object into a hidden hypothetical danger, whose excision from public view reinforces values and even realities the censor is protecting. This conference seeks to understand the power, interactions, and evolution of the censor, censored, and censorship. We welcome presentations addressing theoretical or actual censorship of a range of objects (e.g. text, sound, visual media, education, thought) and from across disciplines (e.g. literature, history, philosophy, film studies, art history, anthropology, politics, law).   
   
 Possible topics include:

· motivations vs justifications for censorship   
 (e.g. were Nazi campaigns against ‘degenerate art’ actually about aesthetics?)

· power dynamics in censorship   
 (does the term ‘self-censorship’ misrepresent the source of censorship?)

· censorship’s production of discourse  
 (how are Critical Race Theory bans attempting to alter understandings of history?) 

· defining the parameters of censorable material   
 (what is ‘pornography’?) 

· geographic, cultural, historical differences in censorship   
 (how does censorship of Chinese-funded journalism abroad vs domestically compare?) 

· new concepts in censorship   
 (how did ‘fake news’ go from describing deceptive information to justifying censorship?)

· new censors   
 (how have ‘fact checkers’ led to social media censoring science in the covid-19 info war?) 

· speculative futures of censorship   
 (will capitalist net-partiality breed new forms of censorship?) 

**Please send an abstract of your proposed presentation (200–300 words) and a brief bio to Dr L. Acadia (acadia@ntu.edu.tw) by Sept 7, 2021.** 

The evaluation committee—Professors Acadia (NTU), Santiago Juan-Navarro (Florida International University), and Greg Simons (Uppsala University)—will evaluate the abstracts and set the conference program.

52,Vision as Dept. Chair,"I'm starting my second year as department chair. All the articles on being a good chair seem to suggest that the chair should have a vision for how the department should look in the future and work toward that. I'm not sure I have one. And even if I did, I don't see how I could implement it.

First, I'm in the weeds just trying to make things work during a pandemic. What classes can we schedule, are they online, in-person, etc. How to you get to campus with proof of vaccination, keeping faculty from panicking that they are going to die if they are teaching in-person, etc. And then there are all the student issues.

Second, there is no money. There wasn't any before the pandemic. There is less now. We can't even hire a student to help properly staff the office and we haven't gotten a budget for office supplies for the year. No one's computers are getting replaced either. New faculty lines, forget it.

Third, the administration uses the budget crunch to create a Darwinian environment of all against all to undermine shared governance. To get scare (when they exist) resources you have to help further undermine shared governance by agreeing to searches that go through abnormal processes and allow the admin to micro-manage areas of department governance. Resisters will be punished. I worry when my faculty complain, it'll get to the wrong ears and we will be punished.

I have made some progress on minor curricular things that had been undone by previous chairs. And have fought to get faculty promoted and retain their leaves. But frankly, the leaves and promotions have been slam dunks, so I don't think I get credit there. I've also tried to improve our relations with the administration without selling our souls and protect the department from too baleful of interference and keep course schedules, etc. reasonable. Maybe there is progress there, but any reward will be years out or is just rear-guard, try to keep what you have stuff. No vision for a future, better department. 

What I fear is that even if there was an opportunity to improve, I wouldn't know what to do with it. I know what sort of lines my colleagues hope the department would get. I'm happy to advocate on their behalf, but that's their vision (and they are somewhat competing visions), not mine. We are supposed to work to improve student engagement, I don't enjoy that at all and certainly have no vision about what that looks like.

In short, I think I'm fine at the day-to-day bureaucracy, but I'm just minding the shop. No one will tell me I'm doing a bad job--no one else wants the job and the admin certainly won't tell me if they are manipulating me. I see people talk about how rewarding it was that they got X, Y, and Z done. I'm just hoping no one dies of COVID and everyone gets promoted or tenure on schedule.

I just have a thought about the attributes of all the professors I ever had throughout my college careers and what makes them a ""good"" professor in the sense. I come up with conclusion that these are professors that did spend some time,10 years or more, in real world and be able to share their wisdom learned from corporate world, that is particular applicable in business and technical degrees. 

Those that I abhor are those that went through whole academia journey without any break and any significant job experience in private sector. Two years of the entry level position isn't significantly helpful to teach your students and preparing them for real world. They seem to have hard time articulating how the theoretical concepts are useful, and they are the ones usually gives ton of assignments/ projects without realistic timeline for students to finish them, or expecting the students to spend 15 hours a week just doing their class's homework.

62,Having a quarter life crisis trying to decide whether to get a PhD or not,"I just began my masters in environmental engineering in June (what I have a bachelors in). So far I am LOVING it. I love doing my research at my own pace, on my own schedule, and being proud of my work. I love the idea of working in academia and having free reign over my work schedule. Obviously I have to put in the work, but no ones breathing down my neck to make sure I’m at the office at 8am, etc. I love the flexibility and self-responsibility that seems to come with a career in academia. I also want to feel fulfilled in my work, and I’m not sure if industry jobs in ENVE provide that for me. Research does so far. 

I had an internship with a consultation firm and absolutely HATED it. I felt like choosing my major was such a mistake. I chose ENVE thinking I’d be “fixing” pollution, solving climate change, etc. At least in my state, almost all environmental engineering jobs are consultation. Water infrastructure is mind numbing to me, and I can never see myself working in a firm, 9-5, with projects that aren’t meaningful to me. I can 100% see myself as a researcher and professor. 

Here’s the dilemma: I hear so many horror stories about the stress and burn out of trying to get tenured or being paid total shit as a new faculty member of a university. I also plan on getting my PhD at the same university I’ve been at since undergrad, and I worry how that will affect the ability to secure a job. I worry PhD experiences are much different than masters, and I’ll be making a huge mistake. 

However I want to dedicate my life to environmental/ecological protection, and I feel that academia is “my” way of doing that. Any advice/input?",academia,1629946950

The typo is early and says ""...working to abolishing race and class-based inequalities..."" instead of ""...working to abolish race and class-based inequalities...""

I love my advisors and my department, I now can’t imagine doing anything else. I more than likely will pursue a PhD, it’s something I planned on doing pretty much since day one of undergrad. 

However, I hear it’s career suicide to get all three degrees from the same institution. Let alone the fact that I want to become faculty here. It’s hard to find a lot of information on that though, especially when it seems to vary by field.

65,The dreaded first R01 seems so far out of reach.,"This is going to be rambly, but after a string of ND grants I'm starting to panic. 

I graduated in 2014 with an experimental psychology PHD, and got a post-doc at an R1 school. Salaries are covered through grant funding--I don't teach. I focused exclusively on research, and managed to get an NIH funded K01 (a mentored grant that helps new investigators toward independence) that covered my salary for five years, moving up to assistant professor. With my research focus, I at first did very well, and was able to complete the data collection part of the K within the first two years. I intended to collect additional pilot data to use in other projects in the following year.

Then COVID hit. 

Long story short, my initial productivity ground to a halt. COVID killed research in human subjects, which is the backbone of psychology research. Without that pilot data, it became very hard to submit reasonable grants. I've got one grant left to hear back on, but out of 5 grants submitted, I got three NDs, one not funded (outside funding, so no chance to resubmit) and the remaining R01. Without being in the lab, my collaborations dried up. My RAs eventually left and I couldn't replace them. A few senior researchers I worked with died or lost family, which was obviously terrible and affected how fast I got access to some data I needed. I applied for and received an in-university grant to help cope with funding issues due to COVID. 

I've got one year of my K left, plus the university grant which will cover salary for half a year, and then I'm screwed. Given the time it can take to get funding, this is not a good situation to be in. 

My K01 mentor has been helping me, but with the string of NDs on grants I sense he's getting frustrated, and distancing himself. The stench of failure is not one many people like to stick around for. I have a collaborator who is considering putting me on a few grants with some minor salary support, but I wasn't able to receive the training I should have gotten during the K, so I can't offer much that he couldn't do himself.  Plus I need to be able to get my own funding. The whole goal of the K is to become independent, and I'm now more dependent than ever. 

Obviously I'm stressed out and considering options. I like the freedom academia gives--making my own hours is great, and I enjoy researching things I consider important. I have nearly two dozen publications, which could be better but isn't terrible. Plus due to family I'm locked into one location. But I'm starting to hate the stress. I'm in my 30's and have developed high blood pressure and heart issues. I don't know if it's due to stress, but I'm sure the stress isn't helping. I find myself unsure what to do and how to spend my time to pull myself out of this slump. The answer seems like ""write more grants,"" but it's hard to maintain momentum when that clearly isn't working. Plus I do have data to analyze and papers to write, and I'm so sick of working so hard on grants to get nothing. 

 I've considered looking into medical writing, but if I can't write a grant well enough to get it funded, who's going to want me as a medical writer? 

Everything was going so well, until it suddenly wasn't.

It's paywalled, and I wanted to reach out to one of the paper's authors to see if they would mind sending me a copy or if I could ask them about the specific topic I'm interested in. 

There are multiple authors, but most are medical doctors/specialists that are now in private practice and no longer connected to an academic institution. I haven't been able to find a professional email for any of them. The only thing I did find was that one of the authors has a twitter account--it's a mix of personal stuff as well as sharing of medicine/specialty-related news articles. 

I feel it might be inappropriate to message this person over social media, but I've never really done something like this. Would this be ok?

I am a PhD researcher with one publication under my belt and another one that is currently under review. My first paper was published in Oct 2020 in the journal of Food Chemistry. To my understanding I was not able to make a public copy of my paper available on ResearchGate for a period of one year? (feel free to correct me if I am wrong). And I thought fair enough, although I highly disagree with the concept of not being able to share my work, that I have completed, analysed, written and edited.

73,One of my 'woke' professors casually ruined my life,"I am a Masters student and this is my final year where I am supposed to submit my thesis. According to one of the professors in my department (nobody is telling me who), my thesis is horribly written where I am using 'archaic' English, and thus, I need to rewrite the whole thing again. The biggest mistake I apparently made in my thesis is that I used the term ""male and female subjects"" everywhere to differentiate between the sample population instead of using ""men and women subjects"" which is more correct according to that professor. And for this, I am being pushed back for 6 months.  


I am not White like the native population here. I am not from this country; I am not from a privileged background.  In fact, I am solely able to make it to this country because of the scholarship I got, thanks to all the work I did back in my country. I cannot even imagine studying in such an expensive university. My scholarship ends this month and I won't be graduating anytime soon. I don't have money to live here or survive for the next 6 months. I tried asking who was the extremely dissatisfied professor and all my supervisor could tell me was that 'she was one of the female professors in the department' (ironic).   


But seriously, fuck this. Academia is full of sadistic and pathetic people. I have seen horrible professors in my life but to hold me back for this minor 'error' that I can change easily, has to be the worst ever. I recommend if you're financially stable and have other options (unlike me), go for them. Stay away from academia. Being called a doctor is not worth it if these are the people who will be giving you the right to call yourself that. As for me, I am going back to my country and will sell burgers or something lol. I hope that professor lives a good life knowing she saved the world with her correct gender representation with few insignificant people's dreams being crushed, which is just a small price to pay.

I'm a history student and currently writing my MA thesis. It's going well, I'm already also working in a research centre. My thesis is a lot of fun, I get to work with original historical documents, my colleagues are fantastic people, I can pay my rent and all should be well. 

However, during the past I've always struggled with the use of all this. Sometimes it seems like none of my research results are relevant for anyone except a very small group of individuals. Whether or not I can proof something about events that happened 500 years ago, it won't improve the live of anyone - or so it feels.

Especially in these difficult times around the world, I find a lack of purpose in my work. The topic of work/life balance has been discussed here before, but frankly, I would like to also work in a profession that ""contributes to society"", to use the expression.

87,is research supervision research or teaching?,"This is a question in the Australian context but I'd be pleased to hear perspectives from around the world. 

Currently my Arts faculty considers higher degree research (HDR) supervisions (PhD, MPhil) as teaching workload and we get a certain number of hours per year for each student based on whether they are full-time, part-time, sole supervision or joint etc. 

We are negotiating a new workload agreement and have had instructions from the university that they want/need to make supervision consistent across the university, and as the other big faculties like science and medicine place  supervision under research, this means we should conform to their workload model, or at best, have a max number of supervisions (2 or 3) in our teaching workload and any extra we want do under research.

For mixed 'teaching and research' staff (most of us) this practically means we lose teaching workload that we will have to make up with coursework classes. HDR completions will be considered as research performance for promotions, but no doubt the university wanting to increase our teaching capacity for profitability reasons is the real purpose. 

We can resist it on that basis, but I'm keen to hear good arguments for why HDR supervision should be either category.

My thoughts on it changing to research:

• this is the model in science, but arts and the humanities are not science. Our candidates have diverse research topics that do not always align with the supervisors research field, even if the supervisors are otherwise highly qualified for other reasons (like domain, theory or methodology expertise). 

• Having supervisions in research might work ok for science and other disciplines, but there are certainly problems. There is a history of supervisors bullying candidates into unpaid RA work or paper writing to offset the supervision workload. The minimum requirement for co-authorship according to the Vancouver Protocol is absurdly low, encouraging supervisors to 'piggyback'  on candidates' research outputs. Having supervision in teaching instead of research can't prevent this but should discourage it. My concern is having it in research creates a potential for these harms in the scientific disciplines emerging in our faculty (it is not currently an issue AFAIK).

• We are IMO generally overworked with teaching already (especially online during COVID) and this either will disincentivize HDR supervision, reducing faculty research-building capacity, and/or reduce the time for research outputs, reducing research impact.",academia,1629681006

92,Is it worth it for the teaching?,"I am in my late 20s and I work at a university library where I get to help and supervise students who show up on a voluntary basis. I really enjoy meeting students one on one or in small groups. I don’t have to create courses or assignments and I don’t have to grade students, I rather help them with study skills, writing and referencing and sometimes some emotional support. 

I stumbled into this job; my original plan as an undergrad and later master’s student was to eventually become a university professor. However, I’m questioning that dream more the more I learn about it. I think the main problems are that I don’t want a job that turns into a lifestyle, and I don’t particularly enjoy doing research. Sure, it was a nice feeling to finally see the results of my theses as a student, but I’m not sure I see myself pouring over data, writing, revising, presenting and reviewing for the next 40 years. Unless I discover something that profoundly changes the world, I think I might be full or regret when I retire. 

What appeals to me about the professor role is the teaching, especially at undergrad level. I do not want to teach in schools due to how thankless it is, but I get so much more energy from exchanges with young students than from working with research data. 

But with professors (especially on here) it often seems like it’s the other way around - many seem to live for their research whereas the teaching is a necessarily evil. Should I just stay in the library sector and work with student support, since it’s probably as close as I’ll get to what I want? I am young and I could probably develop this role to make it even more interesting.

8,Vent - author and editor drama,"I don't have a question. It's just a vent.

Years ago, I reviewed a crappy paper. Usually, the story ends there.

However, the editor of the journal, who agreed that it was a crappy paper, really wanted the topic of the paper to be published so they asked me if I wanted to jump in as a co-author and improve the paper. 

Current team: Authors X and Y. Y has a solid publication record in the field and is very experienced and well-known, but they are currently an administrator. X was not a person I knew but I knew that the editor knew them well. 

I said yes. I knew that Y would not be working on the paper much but an experienced author can spend 20 minutes on a paper and give you golden advice that moves it along by miles. No worries.

Author X turned out to be 100% incompetent and clueless. I actually have a spreadsheet with dates and everything of each time I told them to do something and they either did not do it or did a shitty job. I was very frustrated and angry but I kept going because I respect the editor and author Y.

I think we are in year 3 of this circus and on the second R&amp;R. I'm tired of this paper and of doing it alone with the pretense of doing it with co-authors. The second R&amp;R seemed straight forward so I told X to take the lead and do it. I ""accidentally"" replied to all so that the editor would know the shitty version that is coming is not from me.

Emails started flying back and forth. In one email, the editor suggested adding another co-author. In another email, the editor says that if X is going to write the R&amp;R then they should submit every section to the editor to make sure it is going in the right direction. Also, please make sure you can meet the deadline.

Conclusion: (1) the editor knows X is not capable,  (2) the editor knew that I would have to write this whole thing on my own while babysitting X, and (3) now the editor wants to add another babysitter.

I am beyond mad at the time I have wasted on this. I also feel wronged by the editor. I thought they didn't know X was incompetent. Now it is clear that they knew and they did not care who had to endure what to ensure this moron gets a paper.

That's all folks! It feels good to vent.

Which option would work out as a suitable pathway given my career goals?

28,"Slow dissertation progress, feeling burnt out","A vent post, but advice is also appreciated

I'm a PhD candidate in the humanities and feeling sort of lost in my research due to pandemic disruption and certain insecurities I have about my research skills. I defended my dissertation proposal in May 2020, two months after everything shut down for covid. I was already a semester later than normative time because during my quals my committee and I decided the topic of my dissertation would change significantly. A topic that i thought would be part of a chapter turned into the whole project and I had to do quite a bit of reading - much of it in a foreign language - before I could draft the proposal. (We typically defend a semester after passing our quals.). Then i spent the first year of the dissertation floundering quite a bit. I always struggle to get organized at the beginning of a big project and I was also teaching comp courses online for the summer and fall, which left me burnt out and unable to focus on my work. I got back on track somewhat in the spring, but my first chapter has been completely restructured several times, and although I now feel like I have a solid path forward and have been writing every weekday, it's still progressing painstakingly slowly. I know the process takes time, but I'm entering my seventh year of the program and will need to go on the job market and wrap up in my 8th year. 

I was really lucky to get a summer writing grant which had a stipulation that we check in and out with accountability groups every day and my group has decided to continue into the school year. Thankfully that's added some structure to my days, but ideally I would be working more than I am now.  I'm just burnt out, and on the slow days it's hard not to get overwhelmed by imposter syndrome. This is aggravated by the fact that I've been struggling with neck pain and concentration issues (diagnosed adhd) whenever I try to read. (Our library has most of the sources we need electronically while the stacks have been closed, but it means I have to squint even more at a computer screen, which is no good for my health issues.)

30,How to cope with anxiety going back to Uni and in-person events?,"Hi all!
I hope life is treating you kind. I am about to start my last Ph.D year (hopefully at least) which means that i have been writing my dissertation mostly from home and i have not really been able to attend in-person conferences.
My university has sent us an email informing us about how we are going fully back to normal and we are expected back in the office and my anxiety has skyrocketted. 
I am mostly an introvert and i have had very rough experiences in another university which makes in-person events (conferences, department meetings, social work events…) very triggering. As much as i love academia i am aware that there are several situations that work as triggers and i have been working on that for years.
Nonetheless, having worked alone at home for almost a year with the sole social contact of my home town friends has take its toll on my own skills and i fear it is already affecting my “back-to normal” work to the point that today i throw a major ugly cry moment triggered by being accepted for a conference.
Any suggestions or tips on how to cope ? I’m already working with a psycologist and i’ve taken public speaking courses but i still get that moment in bed where all my “mistakes” for the day are played in slowmo.
Also, would you recommend i inform of this to my supervisor? They are usually very helpful but i fear it may damage my prospectives at they helping me staying in academia.

34,Needy grad student - Venting,"I have been working with this grad student for 4 months now and it is not improving, unfortunately. I am a postdoc, so I am not their official advisor, but their advisor has tasked me with being their mentor. When they arrived, I wanted to make sure they had a smooth start (unlike what I had when I came in), so I introduced them to everyone and started to work with them on some devices needed for their research. I now think it was a mistake, and they now feel entitled to all that attention from me.

I find they really lack in autonomy and it does not help that our desks are very close together. They just ask me all the questions they have, as they come into their heads (more than 20x a day). When I leave for an experiment, they ask me where I am going. They want to follow me when I work in the lab and they want me to teach them EVERYTHING. I told them to make a list of questions and to try to answer some of them themselves. They started doing it for the ""important"" people like our advisor, but not with me. When I don't know the answer or when I can see they clearly didn't make an effort to do any research on their own and tell them to do so, they go to someone else and then it seems like I am not doing my job at helping them. They are also showing some signs of manipulation that worry me a little. 

I am not used to this, my advisors have never been available to me more than once a week (more often once a month) and I was raised to take care of things on my own (maybe too much). I am also not from the US and I sometimes wonder if it is an American thing, since students pay so much for school, that they feel like we are their servants? Are we? I am feeling trapped in this situation. I feel like complaining about it to my advisor will be seen as a failure at my task. But then again I have trouble focusing on my research because I feel like I have this baby bird yelling for me to bring it food all the time. They are also not really grateful and only thanked me when they saw another student thank me for helping them (I spend about 10% of the time I spend with them helping that one, I could also feel they were annoyed by it and would try to paint that person in a negative way when talking about them).

I have tried telling them I value autonomy, and like I said, telling them to make lists of questions and trying to come up with the answers on their own. I give them long-term tasks that they should be able to work on on their own. I have also told them firmly that they need to be more patient with other people. It seems like those things make them more impatient even.

41,Grad international students in new country,"I am an international student doing my Ph.D. in the US. I´ve been here for 3 years, and I don't feel like I can fit with most of my peers.

When I came for the first time to my department, and specifically to my lab, I met three women that were doing their Ph.D., and they were all international students. I would say that that was one of my motivations to join the lab, they seemed happy and I felt represented (even if no one was from my continent lol). Now, they are gone, and each year there are more American students in the department, and please don't get me wrong, they are great people, it´s just that we do not have anything in common, when we are together I do not speak much because I can't have an opinion in many things (like politics), or they do not have an opinion in my things, or they seem a little upset when I take my time speaking because I am not fluent yet.

Also, from the beginning, and not just in my department, I noticed that there exist two groups of friends: international students and Americans. Some international students join the American group, but most of them had a privileged life before coming to the US. I have spoken with some international students that also feel the same about this. Some phrases stayed in my head because I can relate to some of them. One of them said ""I feel like people here hate me"", another told me ""I am not sure, but I feel like some of them think that I am not capable of speak with them"", and another one said, ""I feel more discriminated here because I am Latina than because I am a woman"". 

I cannot avoid feeling a little rejected, and I know that no one is doing anything wrong we are just different. But every year fewer international students come (I guess covid is a reason) and the friends that I use to have are not here anymore.

42,Rereading your old work (typos/getting over imposter syndrome),"Hey all,

I submitted my PhD (History) at the end of 2014 and was awarded it post-corrections (mainly defining key terms in the intro, picking up some errors identified by examiners and adding a couple of books I hadn't referred to) a few months later. 

I'd already started working before I submitted and after I got my doctorate I didn't really think about my thesis: a copy went to the library and another went to my Dad's bookshelf. 

After further research/reading I'm putting together a monograph that draws heavily from doctoral project and have been rereading my thesis in some detail. Oh my days....the typos, the editing (or lack thereof), the weak writing!

I could understand a few mistakes, but highlights so far include: Untied States (more than once), affect as a noun, misspelling authors (Buollock; Hathway) in the footnotes, lurching into a passive voice repeatedly and a raft of rogue commas and apostrophes. It feels like every time I look at it I find something new, each mistake just a little more discomforting than the last.

Even though I write for a living, I just can't stop thinking about it. Seriously, I'm balled up, cringing as I type this.  Scrolling through the text I'm shocked by how many red lines I can see under the text (which I somehow missed 7 years ago - was Apple Pages' spellchecker really that bad!?) 

I think the research itself remains solid - and was used in a couple of papers/conference appearances - but I can't help but feel being awarded my doctorate *must* have been some kind of administrative error. I've got a proposal and heavily-updated draft chapter of my monograph out for peer review and have a sinking feeling like somehow these mistakes prove I'm not good enough and probably shouldn't have begun a PhD at all. 

I'm probably being neurotic, but surely I'm not the only person who has felt like this? Does anyone have any tips for getting over my acute embarrassment beyond swiping my thesis from the library and replacing it with a 'clean' copy? Is this just a sign of maturity and that I've improved as a writer? 

Thanks for reading. Any pointers about imposter syndrome are hugely welcome!

P.s. a note for any prospective or current doctoral students: get a friend/loved one to read your work, and don't think ""this will do"" about something as important as your 100,000+ word thesis!

&gt;\[University\] asks that students do not get tested outside of \[university\] if a student believes they have been exposed—please call Student Health Services \[phone\]. Testing out of fear of  exposure or as a precaution is not a productive use of your time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don’t decide to quarantine because you “think” you have been exposed. Contact \[email\]  to discuss the circumstances. Close contacts are identified through  contact tracing and contacted with instructions individually.

Curious to hear 1) if others are getting similar messaging and 2) what you think of it. 

I find the message pretty uncomfortable; to me, it feels like the main goal is to create an impression of ""everything is fine and under control"" (probably at least partly due to enrollment concerns). Frankly, given the level of uncertainty and change we've already seen, that doesn't feel like a super responsible message to be sending; and while I understand the point that clinicians are the people best positioned to evaluate exposure risks, telling students that precautionary testing is ""not a productive use of your time"" and trying to control where they access testing feels like a red flag.",academia,1628982548

However, I have started thinking now whether that is a good idea... In the evaluation committee there will be many researchers that are in the same field as I am. Now, if I end up not getting the position and my proposal is not funded either, do I run the risk of giving my novel idea away ""for free""?

Longtime lurker looking for life advice or suggestions from those in academia.

In brief, I am finishing my SEVENTH year of my PhD in the social sciences, which is my school program’s time limit. So, basically, I am wondering whether it’s time to pull the plug - if I really have outstayed my chances at future employment in the field (because it looks bad).

In short, my reasoning for taking long is a mixture of life events. First, throughout these 7 years, I have sessional lectured multiple courses, held RAships every year, leading to a couple minor publications, and I have been a TA in over 20 courses. Money has always been an issue for me, despite having funding. 

Outside of the working load, I spent two years in another city to support my partner’s career, was diagnosed with a chronic illness, which required heavy stints of medication, have suffered from extreme depression, and if I’m being honest, I’ve  procrastinated (feverishly avoided) my dissertation at times to get where I am today. 

I’ve written four of six chapters thus far with decent feedback, though my committee and supervisor have basically ignored my pleas for help and I fear whether I’ll ever be able to finish at this rate.

Given I have to apply to extend past my program’s time limit, I was wondering:

Should I bother continuing? Have I outstayed my chance at gainful employment in academia? Have others taken as long and still gotten jobs and/or funding? Or, am I just prolonging the inevitable? I feel like I have a poor conception of reality at this point.",academia,1628834916

Essentially, I am preparing to begin PhD applications soon, and have been considering where I would like to study my doctorate at. My goal is to attain a professorship position in the UK (preferably London) in the future. My wife lives in the UK, and I would like to move in with her sooner rather than later, whilst also making the right decisions for our economic future. I should hopefully be competitive for top programs in both the UK and US (altho my GRE score is not the greatest for US schools that are considering it, a 315, I am retaking it this summer but have not been preparing very thoroughly…). 

Pros: 
I have read that UK PhD students have much better benefits and work-life balance compared to US doctoral programs (?)
Being able to live with my SO while pursuing my PhD would be really good for my mental health esp considering how high pressure it is (and being able to share living costs)
I like the UK more than the US
No GRE scores considered
Much simpler application process

Cons:
I have read online that UK PhD programs tend to be minimal supervision with little support or structure, and I would like more support/direction from my advisor given I switched to Soc from my Undergrad major
I have read that UK Sociology PhD’s are not as rigorous/prestigious as US ones and do not perform as well in placements for professorship positions (?), is this also true in the UK?
I am also worried about PhD funding for UK unis, which tend to be competitive for US international students (?) and not guaranteed (although I think I will hopefully be competitive for funding)
These worries are the only things holding me back from deciding to pursue a PhD in the UK…

I have gotten myself in a little bit of a pickle and I'm unsure how to navigate this situation, so I was hoping for some input (preferable from post doc / staff scientists, (junior) pIs if possible but anyone is ofcourse welcome to comment).

Background: I'm currently employed as a research assistant in the EU for two years by now, and my contract is ending in a few months even though the project is not finished (due to reasons beyond my control, hello DEC and Covid). My PI wants to extend my contract so that I could atleast finish the project, but I would much rather now start a PhD position. My PI is aware of this and they are interested in having me as a PhD student, but we haven't secured any funding yet (we are amending a grant to submit as we speak). 

Due to the major insecurity whether or not I could even stay here once my contract is up, or that we manage to secure a grant, in which I am also the successful applicant, I have applied for two PhD projects elsewhere. Both universities are interested to atleast proceed my application to the next step, and this is where the trouble comes in;

I have informed my PI I am keeping my options open with regards to the current project and the grant, as there is too little certainty for me that I can continue (as we haven't secured any additional funding). I did not explicitely say that I am applying elsewhere, as I was hoping to have that conversation with my PI if I had an actual offer on the table. 

One of the PhD locations wants to have the contact details of my PI as a reference and I'm unsure how to navigate this. I don't fear what my PI has to say about me but I don't want them to be completely blindsided by this either. 

Can I ask to keep my application confidential until I am further in the application procedure, or should I go ahead and inform my PI already even though I have no real offer on the table (haven't had an interview with them yet either)? 

*As additional info: I am a bit concerned about the reaction from my PI, I worry that if I tell them now I am applying elsewhere, I will strain the working relationship, and should neither location end up making me an offer, I am not sure how to continue my work presently. I definitely don't want them to feel bad or upset, and I want to be as transparant as possible, but I also don't want to shoot myself in the foot by either prematurely telling them I am applying, or by passing up on more certain options.*

 *The grant is not written from scratch, it was an old grant that got rejected but we're making changes to it to improve it, and it is tailored to our interests. It is a good project so I have no doubt that, should I not be applying for it, they will find a great candidate for it in no time.*",academia,1628786887

73,"Bumped from first-author, not sure how I feel...","I'm a grad student, lagging really behind because of depression, burnout, and personal issues. My work completely stalled last year. My advisors were totally understanding and supportive, but we needed to get a project done... a project that had really taken quite too long already.

We decided on a pragmatic solution. My advisor suggested we bring in another grad student who was working on similar - but supposedly superior - methods to finish up the paper. They would get credit as first author for wrapping this paper up for us with the new methods.

I cleaned up the data and coached the student a little. Contemporaneously, my work improved a bit too, and I started getting results. The next meeting, the other student had some cool results ready... but I had similar results. My advisor thought I was competing, but I really wasn't.

After the student dropped their cleaned results off, they left the project. They did not write any part of the paper - not even figure captions. I wrote about 2/3rds of the paper, because I'm the one who understands the context of the paper outside the methods.

To top it off, the other student didn't use the new, advanced method they were working on. They used the same one I was trying.

Now the paper is almost done. All other figures and the bulk of the writing is mine. But I'm second author. I feel this is unfair, but my advisor feels weird about switching the author order, because he promised the other student authorship. He said he considers us both first authors.

Should I just move on, or should I push a bit more before we publish a preprint? I have nothing against the other student or my advisor. I'm cool with the other student being *an* author. I'm just trying to look after myself here after spending a considerable amount of time on this project.

I am an incoming grad student and am wanting to find out more about how other academics structure their reading schedules, if they have one at all. I often encounter scholars who seem to have read everything under the sun, both in terms of the more technical classics of their respective field, as well as current scholarship as it comes out. I am wondering how people do this in addition to completing their own research, teaching duties, and so forth. 

I am especially curious at how people manage to increase their breadth in both current scholarship, but also the more demanding titles and authors. In philosophy for example, it is one thing to read  scholarship on particular philosophers, and it is another  to read philosophy proper. Surely scholars continue this latter reading in their personal time after graduate school, since one cannot take a class on *everything.* But how, in addition to everything else?",academia,1628711779
76,How do you manage your literature and references?,"Hi all,

I have many PDFs (articles, reports and other literature) in various folders, and most of them are also in Endnote, which I have always used as a reference manager. However, the references in Endnote are not linked to the PDFs (most of the references were downloaded from journals' pages, but Endnote can find the PDFs for only \~30% of the references I have in there) and I do not have any 'tag' for the papers. My plan to fix and have a more organized library is the following:

* Re-download references directly from journals (hoping that Endnote this time might find the PDFs for these)
* Link remaining PDFs manually, putting all PDFs (including the ones from the point above) in one folder
* Link PDFs to NVivo, so to add different tags to the same article and to search more easily through the literature

However, this manual process seems to me very slow and easily prone to mistakes. Therefore, a few questions:

* Can this process be automated somehow? Looking into the future, how do you go with downloading individual PDF and references and keeping the literature tidy?
* Are there other options for having all PDFs in one folder (possibly with file names corresponding to ""author year title""), linked to a reference management software (Mendeley, Endnote, or Zotero?), linked to NVivo?
* More in general, **how do you manage your literature**?

ABSTRACT

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a common haematological cancer that is comprised of approximately 30 subtypes, of which Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare incurable form. It is typically managed using a watch-and-wait strategy that can contribute to illness uncertainty which may result in fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and poor health-related quality of life (QOL). However, few studies have examined the correlates of FCR and QOL in NHL patients, including WM patients. One-hundred males and 92 females with a mean age of 62.7 years who were an average of 6.8 years from diagnosis completed the online questionnaire which asked about demographics, medical history, QOL, FCR, stress, anxiety and depression. Few NHL patients reported significant stress or affective distress, most had moderate-high QOL and 41% experienced recent FCR, relative to published cut-off scores. Poorer QOL was related to depression symptoms, FCR, higher illness burden (i.e. comorbidity) and fewer personal resources (i.e. unemployed), whereas FCR was related to shorter time since diagnosis and more depressive symptoms. Results suggest that FCR and depressive symptoms may adversely impact QOL, whereas a recent cancer diagnosis and depression-related pessimism may contribute to FCR.",academia,1628641995

I’ve lived in Scotland before but in a large city quite far away from where the job is so would have to travel to see old friends. So I’d be starting from scratch at the age of 45 as I started all this as a mature student.   


I have a long term relationship (13 years) but we have been long distance for 2 years while I was doing my post doc. She works for a think tank in the city we did our phds, a large city in England. The relationship is hanging by a thread as it is after all the stress and separation. She is also 12 years younger than me so I’m not sure she would be happy to swap a cosmopolitan city for a small deprived Scottish town, although property is cheap there and it’s close to a big city. My girlfrien is Swiss and we’ve previously lived in Zurich, Berlin and London, so the Scottish town is a big step down.

If I were younger I’d probably not be very keen myself but at 45 I do feel like I’m not in a position to pass it up. However I worry that my age will make it difficult to start again, especially if my girlfriend and I do split up. I might have a job but no social circle and have to start internet dating to try and meet a partner at 45 +

93,Middle East and Technology,"I have a BA degrees in geography and computer science, and worked for two years as a software developer for a well-known social media company. I did a lot of work looking at spam (deciding what to ""censor""), detecting CP on our systems, and wrangling our policies for political internet firewalls, such as [Turkey's](https://mashable.com/article/turkey-blocks-tor-vpn-censorship).

I'm planning to apply to MA programs in regional studies for the Middle East, and would like to talk about my plans to study technology with regard to the Middle East. I want to study social media in the Middle East, and the use of firewalls and digital censorship by authoritarian governments, especially in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and the UAE.

I'm a UK citizen working postdoc-ing in an EU country, and will probably be here for the next couple of years. Given the job market, I may have to switch back and forth between the UK, the EU, the US, and elsewhere for much of my career. 

I'm really aware of pension insecurity, as schemes cannot always be transferred. For example, the pension with my current university can only be released when I reach retirement age and will only be given to me if I'm living in a country in the EU, or one that has a working agreement that allows such a transfer. I understand the UK doesn't currently have such an agreement post-Brexit, so I may risk losing this money unless a future agreement is made, or if I stay in the EU.

Given all this uncertainty, would it be wise to get a private pension, or would registering with the USS help? I've never looked into the matter and am unsure how to navigate it. Would appreciate advice on whether it's recommended and, if so, which funds would be best suited.

99,I Feel Like I'm Being Selfish By Choosing To Pursue Academia,"Hi everyone! This is a little bit of a rant, but I'm also really hoping for some perspective or advice on how to deal with how I'm feeling.

For the past few years of being in school, I've grown to really love the academic environment. It's stressful, it keeps me up and night and I'm constantly feeling like I'm too stupid to be allowed to exist. But I can't imagine myself doing anything else. I am aware how unhealthy this life might be, but I am committed to it. In doing so, I made sure to avoid all romantic relationships and I've also stopped pursuing any hobbies that might take time away from work. Even though I'm really only at the beginning of my journey (applying for grad school), I was certain this was my destiny.

I came back home over the summer, and I recently had a conversation with my parents about my future. My father isn't unhappy with what I plan to do, but he was disappointed that I didn't want to take some time off and pursue some NGO work. I was immediately defensive but I realised that he was right. In my late teens, I was obsessed with doing social work. I used to help out at travelling clinics for the homeless, teach English to children in impoverished areas, conduct financial literacy workshops for orphans, among the other miscellaneous things I'd tried to get into.

But in the past 3 years, my life has been completely replaced with school. I quit all my commitments so I could take up a full time research internship. I stopped involving myself with my volunteer/charity peers so I could study for exams. I replaced all my weekend activities for conferences and talks that I could use to buff up my CV. Somewhere along the way, I stopped thinking about other people, and I became obsessed over how I could make myself better.

It really hit me when I spoke to my supervisor this week. I just felt how detached and privileged we were and it really made me question whether I wanted to become like that. While the COVID situation is at its worst in my country, we were complaining about trivial things, like late email replies and difficulty with the screenshare function on MS Teams. Since everyone is working from home, instead of lending sympathy, we were moaning about how inefficient and slow everything has become with proposals, ethics approvals. 

I suddenly felt weak and I became angry at myself. In the past 3 months of working on this research project, I've thrown myself at it so hard that I blocked out everything around me. My parents do a food drive every week where they hand out food packages to families who are struggling through the lockdown. They've tried to get me involved but I gave excuses like ""I have a programme I need to get running by tomorrow"", ""I have a lot of papers I need to sort out"". I have friends who had family members die from the virus, and instead of checking in on them, I told myself that calling them would take up too much time I could spend reading. What hurts the most is that I've been barely present when my sister was diagnosed with cancer. I felt that since my parents were already dealing with her, I didn't need to get involved and just focus on work.

I just feel so lost now. A huge part of me doesn't want to let go of the academic dream, but at the same time, I can't help but feel immense guilt by feeling this way. I know there is a balance that can be achieved here, but I just don't know where to draw the line.

I know that my view is heavily irrational, but despite all of this, I still feel like I'm not doing enough. I see my peers conducting independent projects, some having their first author publications ever, and I just feel like I need to do more. I think taking some time away from work would help me reevaluate things, but I can't seem to let go because I feel like I'll be left behind the moment I stop working.

But [The Journal Club](https://www.thejournal.club/home/) is also useful for individuals who are looking to discover great new research and organise interesting papers into useful collections, e.g. by topic. You can bookmark papers for later reading and/or endorse papers you think make important contributions. 

In order to enable all this functionality, we maintain a growing database of research papers, authors, venues, datasets and codes. You can help us grow our database by submitting new papers, datasets, and codes.

We built The Journal Club as an internal tool but we thought it is useful enough that we should make it public. We would love your feedback whether positive or negative.

19,Should I mention title IX case in grad school applications?,"So I am applying to PhD programs this fall for STEM (I'm a woman btw). When I was a freshman a professor quickly became like a mentor to me. Anyway long story short he became a stalker and would try to get me alone to touch me etc (sorry if this is uncomfortable). Anyway I filed a title IX report my sophomore year and was ordered to stay off campus for a week and I was taking 18 hours of upper level STEM courses so it was really hard to keep up. So this affected my education a lot and it effected my grades and overall comfort at the university.  He no longer works at the university now.

In every graduate school application they say to mention hardships you've overcome in your academic career and to explain things in your transcript. However, some of my peers have told me not to mention it because I shouldn't make the admission committee uncomfortable or make it seem like I'll be a problem student in the program. I want to ask some professors about their opinion but I can't ask faculty at my school. The one time I tried to talk to my advisor about it, as soon as I mentioned Dr. X's name he was like ""Oh no we can't talk about Dr. X I don't know what happened with him and I'm not supposed to"".

What do you guys think? Should I mention it or should I keep it to myself? If I do mention it, should I keep it brief or how do you think it would best be put?

31,I am worried I am veering away from academia even though this isn't what I want?,"I recently completed my PhD in April and I was delighted with the results. Prior to my viva I thought my PhD was terrible but I got such great responses from the examiners and minor corrections that I actually started to believe in myself again. 

I believe I do have good experience, I have spoken at around 11 conferences, have written and given public talks and been on podcasts. I have written for blogs, newspapers and other websites. I have also taught in a university. 

In the last year of my PhD I worked full time in an archive as a researcher as well, which was insanely stressful but I thought it would help my job prospects. 

My downfall is I have still not published a journal article. I beat myself up about i regularly. I have been invited to write for a special issue of a journal that I will be submitting shortly and I am working on another paper also. But I have been finding it impossible to find any work at all in academia and I understand my lack of journal publications has not helped. 

I think I was so exhausted after finishing the PhD and working full time that I had no energy for months afterwords. My corrections, though minor, were quite in depth and required a lot of work. I have just been totally exhausted and demotivated and at times deeply depressed and lacking confidence in my abilities or future. 

I have recently gotten a job as a library assistant, which will give me opportunities to organise events etc and I believe I'll be able to work on my articles in my spare time which is good. But is this veering me onto the wrong path? I'm so grateful I got that job as I was getting frantic that I have been unemployed for almost a year and was starting to have financial difficulties. It also sounds like it'll be a really great job. I'm just scared that this is the end of academia for me and it's soul crushing. I love research but I'm starting to feel I don't have the ability to pursue it and maybe this is just the end of that journey. Has anyone else gone into a sort of related but different line of work until they found something in academia? Am I making a mistake?

33,Feeling like I am always one step behind,"Sorry for the self pity post. I just had to write down my thoughts, but maybe some of you will find it entertaining. 

For as long as I can remember I have always been like that. I was just shy of making it to the national imo team, the people I met there all lead respected academic careers now. My family then moved to the US when I was in eleventh grade. I didn’t have a good command of English until a year after and I got an SAT score above 2300 after I applied to all the colleges. Obviously I didn’t apply to any of the best ones. Anyways, I got to college but I was immature, struggled, lost, depressed. Later I found my passion for math again and switched from a liberal arts major to math and took five major classes per semester for the last three semesters and made straight A’s. But it was all rushed and too late. I barely got into a grad school, but a decent one I’d say. 

When I got there though I struggled again. I blew it for the whole year and only started to “get” it half way into my second year. I hung on for a few more years passing some exams but failed others and had to pass more to stay. Then I realized I was racing against time as my country wasn’t going to renew my passport until I serve in the military. I decided not to take my last qual.

So I came back to my home country and in military somehow met a major who was in contact with an academic. I started my PhD again at the most prestigious uni in my country. But I quickly realized my advisor who was set to retire in my expected graduation year mostly used up his ideas already. I did work hard, wrote unusually many papers for a grad student in my field, but sort of uninteresting work, irrelevant to current trends. He had a heart attack last year. I graduated with a PhD but with no jobs, no one to write letters for me because I focused on writing not making connections.

I know it’s mostly my fault that I am in this state or I am just not predisposed with “it” to make it in academia. I am thankful for all the second chances I got so far. But I wonder if similar experiences were had by lots of other first generation college students, first generation STEM grad students, first generation immigrants/international students. I think it is the lack of guidance or direction that partly contributed me to be one step behind, always.",academia,1628120308

36,Haven't met PI/seen lab but now I have to WRITE A GRANT?!,"PROBLEM:
Just got an email (early Aug 2021) from a professor whose grant writing class is mandatory for our cohort. On the syllabus it looks like we write a grant the 1st month of school and spend the rest of the semester editing it and figuring out what agencies to send it out to. 

He asks 4 questions, maybe y'all could share how you might've responded/not responded at this stage? Or if it was even expected of you to know these things this early? Things you would've liked to know about at this point?:

1. Do you plan to write/submit an NSF GRFP (= NSF predoc proposal) this fall semester, have you submitted a GRFP before, or do you plan to submit some other grant-proposal this fall?

2. Do you know how to use the program 'R' to draw a graph and do stats?  Should I include a segment on basic R in the Grad Skills class, as I did in previous years?

3. What other skills do you hope to learn in your first semester in the Skills Grad Course?  Please take a look at the attached syllabus from last year; are there are any topics that we did not cover last year, but that you like to be included this coming fall?

4. Please send me three keywords describing your research interests (e.g., population ecology, disease evolution, genomics).

BACKGROUND:
 I just graduated undergrad (Dec 2020) and was accepted into a bio related PhD program. I only spoke to my PIs ONCE during Zoom recruitment day interview (Feb 2021) where they spent most of the time trying to convince me to go to their university and I didn't get to ask my questions. I just emailed them my questions about this class and projects they might have in mind but they are on a business trip (until mid Aug 2021) and are unavailable to respond until then. Class starts (Aug 30, 2021) very soon so I have some questions for y'all as well:

5. If my advisors aren't pressed to respond, how hard should I be panicking?

6. How early did y'all begin worrying about grants and projects before the 1st day of school?

7. How many projects/back-up plans did y'all have in mind to present to your PI/other professors before the 1st day of school?

8. How normal is any of this? What was expected of you? How was your research proposal timeline different?

9. What would you be doing to prepare in the meantime in my situation with no correspondence from PI?",academia,1628107907

38,WOC asked to serve on a search committee as a diversity representative,"I am a TT AP (R1) in a pretty non-diverse male dominated field. My department is massive and is made up of several smaller ""sub-departments"" where most of the teaching and research activity take place. There is very little interaction between different subgroups, making each group essentially like its own department. 

Today I was notified by an admin staff that the department chair and a faculty search committee chair of a different subgroup (whom I have never personally met) requested that I serve as a ""diversity representative"" on their search committee. I haven't worked for this department long enough to know for sure, but I have never seen members of other sub-groups serving on each other's search committees before. My group also recently concluded a search and we didn't have anyone working as a diversity representative. 

I am barely keeping my head above water being a TT AP and feeling distraught by this service task that is suddenly dumped on me. It only makes things worse that I learned about this new responsibility through an admin staff who emailed me to berate that I am yet to complete a required online training for the task. So nobody even asked if I am okay with this, they just assigned me 50+ hours of service work and failed to notify me. More sensibly they could have also gotten one of their own members (but this group does not have any WOC). 

I am wondering what my options are here. Is there a way I can protect myself and my time from asking to get out of this assignment? We have a pretty dictatorial department chair and assistant professors are all extremely deferential because of the low tenure rate. Will I be shooting myself in the foot if I ask to be exempt from it? 

To clarify: I am not saying that I do not advocate for diversity. I do. But I do not believe in diversity committees especially in a place like my department where they only seem to ceremonially exist as a line on promotional material or for compliance. I actually believe that they are counterproductive to increasing diversity at the higher levels because so many junior members of color (usually women) are required to put in extra energy that their non-minority counterparts do not have to.",academia,1628105426

46,How should you find a PhD advisor if there is an intent of staying in academia as a Professor,"Academia as if today is a very messy business. It is highly political and money driven. Students who are entering this world have no clue what they are getting into so I want to write down few pointers that could be helpful in telling them about things they should consider before starting their PhD:

(1) Your PhD will be your advisors work. You are merely just a ""research assistant"" and you will basically become their copy, as everyone does. So choose someone whose copy you want to become. 

(2) You would know what your advisor knows. Their field will be your field for a foreseeable future after your PhD. So again choose someone depending on what you would like to know and pursue after your PhD. It takes considerable effort to know a field from inside out to make novel contributions and/or ti change fields. So choose VERY wisely what field you are getting into. Most likely right after an undergrad you have no clue about what any field is like or what you want. Thus doing a Masters from a good school is highly advisable before starting a PhD.

3) Academia is basically a paper writing business. And PhD students are basically tools for the system to keep churning out papers. IMO more than 95% of papers are crap and are basically written by  naive mostly international students coming from poor countries who are in developed world and are attached by strings to stay here through their advisors and are just happy to be in a developed world. The professors very well know this precarious situations and take full advantage of it. There are many professors who will only take smartest of students from poor countries as they don't have many options to leave and go back. 

4) Every advisor wants keep their ship running at full speed and want to take the most out of their student. This is not necessarily a bad thing and can actually be a good thing if the advisor is highly knowledgeable and reputed and is doing excellent work. It is the best way to learn and grow. However, probably more than 80% of faculty in top schools are not this type. Most are enjoying the tenure system, not caring what problems they are working on, if they are meaningful and if that would help students get a job in academia. All they care about is getting 2-3 journal papers out and show the committee you have done something and graduate you and get some grants based on the work to do the same to the next student. It is a very factory/industrial approach on how students are being churned out of the system which feed the industry in US and are very important part of that system.

5) Your early years are one of the most productive years of your life where you have the maximum potential to grow and learn. Your PhD thesis and advisor is a defining feature of your life. In academia you would always be known as a student of this and this until you produce a big enough result so you are known on your own. More than 70% students have no idea about this and randomly choose an advisor based on instinct or whosoever they found acceptable enough. And not surprisingly most people (I would say more than 90% ) look back and don't like what they achieved in their PhD or regret it all together.  But a careful thinking of your taste and what's out there can drastically reduce these unwanted accidents.

6) As I said before, pretty much all professors in academia are exploiting the students to maximum who are naive and cheap labor and young and idealistic. Given the statistics, it is possibly the most common thing to land up with the wrong advisor who use you as paper writing tool and graduate you while you waste the best years of your life neither enjoying nor learning nor making money-- worst of all worlds. 

7) In academic job market, recommendations and the big name of the advisor is probably the most important thing. There are people with much better results who don't get an academic job while a mediocre thesis but big advisor gets you a position.

8) As I said, if you are looking to be in academia later, choose your advisor VERY carefully-- someone who is reputed, is still doing good work in the field you want to work in, has placed students in academia in the past (a very good indicator of how reputed the professor is), is easy to talk to and gives you space. This would exclude 95% of the faculty even in top schools.

9) One of the best perks of being in academia (in theoretical fields) is to be able to interact with highly intelligent people. That is the thrill of life that people seek. Going to a top school as a PhD student and then as a professor ensures that. Whereas in low rank schools the quality of your colleagues and students and professors would decrease and will impact your quality of life. Thus it makes sense to work a little extra to get a masters and get few papers out and then apply for a PhD in a better ranked school with a better known advisor than jumping into this messy world without any experience or perspective.

10) Remember the most important thing you have is your time and while all PhD students want to be philosophically and understand the meaning of life and universe or figure out god, the true meaning of life lies in the decisions you make in your life such as choosing your field, school, friends and advisor that actually shape your life. You are the product of the people you surround yourself with and to live a higher quality life, put yourself in high quality places without any compromise.

Finally please stay away from bad advisors. There are plenty (majority) out there and since the market is so skewed  today with students having virtually no information, they are at the receiving end. And the purpose of this post is to warn you all against such people.",academia,1628029524

48,Life choices: Academia or Relationship (+ Industry job)?,"I (33 yo) have a PhD in physical sciences and experience in the academic environment. After applying for various positions in academia and in industry, I got offers in both environments, which is great. 

The academic position is for a tenure-track position with an interesting start-up package and a wonderful salary. This would be the opportunity to set my own research agenda, and achieve my scientific independence. 

The industry position is to work as an applied researcher, in a field far off mine, where experience can be achieved. Although I may not necessarily love this field, I could see myself adapting towards it and eventually finding interesting problems to solve. The salary would be similar to my present temporary position. 

In terms of locations: the academic position is far away from where I presently live (+8h flight) so I would need to relocate to another Country. The applied researcher position is within a 40 min car ride from where I live.

Here comes the problem: I have been with my girlfriend for 3 years, and she is not interested to move to the academic job location. I understand her point of view: her hobbies are here, her friends are here and the culture of the new place will be different from the present culture we live at. It would be certain for her to find a job in the academic location. 

I can't easily decide between both positions, specially when taking my girlfriend into account in this equation. I understand it is not fair for me to ask her to move. But at the same time I know this (academic) job opportunity probably won't appear ever again.

At my University, there are two approachs to this.

2) People who do the bulk get authorship. For example, your PI had an idea, and asked you to carry it over. You collected the data (under their supervision), analyzed the data (under their supervision) and then wrote the paper and submitted it.

To me, 2) seems to be the fairer. This was a discussion I was having with someone as I personally always saw PIs following the approach I described on 1), but this person I was talking to said it made little sense to them and they (at the same University as me) always saw PIs following 2).

This discussion emerged because I recently collected data and wrote a paper, but I won't be the first author, as this was the PIs idea. Then again, this was the ""normal"" to me, and was wondering how does this work at your research labs.",academia,1627997578

Loads of citations, won small grant applications and won a named fellowship (but turned it down).

However, not being dramatic but academia feels like it’s killing me. The pandemic got rid of any structure with working and I’m constantly working way out of hours and all weekend for incredibly long hours (sometimes 12+ in a day) and often on highly draining, technical projects that are really team rather than individual projects.

To add to that the sacrifices I’ve had to make - feeling constantly stressed about having to share accommodation, having to live far away from my partner, being paid so little that I’m always scraping my credit and an emergency would bankrupt me. My health has begun to decline and I constantly feel like my head is going to explode with stress and I’m gonna vomit.

Anyway, I don’t know what I expect to gain by writing this (except probably “me too” from other academics) but I felt like I needed to scream into the void.",academia,1627952667

60,Start another PhD at 32 years old,"Hi to all :)

I am 32 years old and I have a PhD in Philosophy. I studied at Scuola Normale Superiore but unfortunately I had a terrible experience with both my tutor and the institution. My PhD was almost without publications, and none of them on relevant journals. I had health problems, and some are bothering me still today. The pressure was so high that I started to have psychological problems, burnout, depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety. It took me three years to recover, and now I'm ok (just a bit anxious but totally manageable). I was attending also Academy of fine Arts, but unfortunately I had to stop taking classes due to the pandemic. At the moment I'm doing a very unskilled job that mostly humiliates me. I would like to go back to academic career but as I'm not competitive at all as a researcher I would like to have another PhD. In Italy you can't win a PhD scholarship twice in your life, and I had mine. My family is not rich so I thought that it would be a great idea to have another PhD abroad. I was looking to cold countries like Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Alaska, Canada. 

Am I too old to start another PhD? It can be possible to pursue an academic career starting again at 32 years old? I'm very afraid and kinda depressed that I have lost my chance.",academia,1627945176

I am sorry for being a bummer but not sure where else to voice this.

I have three chapters (approx 20k words, intro, lit review and conclusion) that need major revisions and I have to submit my final version in two weeks. My empirical chapters don't need many changes since they've been checked by my sv's and I've redrafted them more times than I can remember.

Just the thought of having to sit at my desk and finish this in two weeks gave me a panic attack this morning.

70,Help! Adding vulgar language into an academic paper? What are the guidelines?,"I'm in a bit of a weird predicament. I'm writing a paper on peace/conflict studies, focusing on a Middle Eastern minority which is incredibly well-integrated into their country -- to the extent that there is no conflict whatsoever between them and the majority ethnicity. 

One of the strongest examples of how well-adjusted this minority however involves vulgar language. It happened when a TV commentator made a stupid vulgar joke involving the name of this ethnicity, and literally went to jail for a year because he offended them. This specific commentator was also aligned with the politics of the ruling government party, really showing how well-connected individuals can get into trouble for offending this group.

Now the joke itself is about ""vomit-inducing (insert minority name) oral sex."" This is relevant because this joke actually doesn't target this minority based on any stereotype or racist perception -- it was actually taken from twitter where some kids were putting together random strings of vulgar gibberish, and this ""humorous"" phrase was born. 

So my problem is: I want to use the words ""vomit-inducing (insert minority name) oral sex"" in my paper, to describe what actually happened and why people were offended about it. I hate the idea of censoring it when I'm discussing it in something of a sociological context. On the other hand, I'm an undergraduate and don't want my professor to knock off points or complain because I put vulgarity in my paper!

82,I'm out of academia. Taking charge of my mental health and money now,"My anxiety and low self-esteem reached its worst during my PhD (in a STEM field) in UK, where I realised I was just a money making machine for the University and no one really cared for my work. I finished my PhD, and then pursued a post-doctorate hoping if I produced an applicable research that people could use, then I'll be valued. Nope. The only upside was, I was now able to make rent and essentials through the post-doc salary (as opposed to the PhD times).

I questioned what all of this was for. All my work, my time, was hoping to get recognition that I was good at something. Monetary recognition being one of them. At the end of my post-doc, with multiple publications in good journals, all I had was an opportunity to do another 1.5 year post-doc with an annual salary which was £7000 less than than my previous position.

Screw it. I was out of academia. Have just joined the industry and am pissed off, because I didn't research enough before getting into the University. I jumped on an opportunity of PhD, because that's what the ""brilliant"" people did. Because I assumed my supervisor had my best interests in his mind. All lies. Supervisor couldn't care less about my work, he was only in it so he gets free-labour for his spin-out company, and how to make a sellable product. University only cared about if I was paying them their fees. It's all about money!!

I now realise its all about money. Doesn't matter how 'great' my research is, if I don't make money for someone, no one cares. I'm going to try my best to never let myself be in a position where I am almost begging to make rent. Never again. Academia, I'm sure is great for some people, but for me, it was not what it markets itself as...a place of knowledge. BS. If the knowledge is not profitable, no one cares.

If money is what works, then I'm going for it. Screw ""working for the good of humanity"". I had a plush job earlier, which I left for my PhD, thinking I was going to make a ""difference"", I'm going to go and make my services useful to someone who wants to compensate properly. Who shows appreciation beyond just saying, ""oh that's nice, how can we sell this?"". I don't want to check my bank balance everytime I'm out with my friends, to see how much buying that dinner would set me back by. My skills are valued in the industry. I'm sticking to the industry. For all the promises the University made about establishing me as an ""expert"" in the field, all I got was huge debt and mental illness. It's not worth it. I'm worth more.

84,I don’t know how to work things out with my advisors/chairs,"Warning. This is a long story. I already graduated and got my degree. 

I have two chairs, one junior and one senior. So my school is a top school in it's field and most graduates go into academia. When I told my advisors that I was going into industry last year, they freaked out and said it was an interior decision. But it was my decision to make and I made it. 

I wanted to take an internship during my last year after I finish my dissertation and they demanded that I need to see the paper through revision and publication. Otherwise they wouldn't let me take an internship. I was made to believe that I need to publish my dissertation in order to graduate,which was not the case. I was able to finish the paper. 

During my internship (this is after I defended and passed) we need to revise the paper for publication. They got very unhappy that I was too slow with revision while I was juggling interviewing and my internship. I said let's get another co-author (at this point the paper was 95% done) to run some robustness tests. They rejected and put me as second author and put the junior chair as the first author. I though this is how things works and I am afraid they will take away my degree and give me a hard time to graduate, so I had to say yes. After that I shared everything I had worked on for the paper (code , data etc) and answered questions that junior chair has about my code. She submitted the paper as the first author. 

I thought that was the end of it until another revision round came. The junior faculty now claims that my code does not work for her and she cannot do revision work. Truth is she not only didn't tell me what's the issue when I asked her but also didn't seem to open the code at all. She kept asking where are things but I already answered those months ago. She claimed that only I can do the revision work because she cannot replicate my results. Senior faculty believed her that there's something wrong with my code and said ""replication issue is a problem for both the publication and degree"". I have tons of proof that my code works and I have log files from servers to show that I didnt make any results up. I got really pissed and afraid at the same time that they are using my degree to threaten me. 


I am going to have a conversation with my PhD office about this. I am also worried about my degree and my reputation as my senior faculty said she will work with someone in my current company. Months after I graduate I still feel I am being taken advantage of. At this point I have every high anxiety whenever I receive an email from them and it starts to take a toll on my mental health and sleep.

86,I’m a PhD student (not yet ABD) who has been invited to interview for a Lecturer position at a nearby school. Not sure if I should pursue it?,"American uni, btw.

Earlier this week, out of nowhere, I got an email from the department head at a nearby school that I’d been recommended by a colleague to interview for a lecturer position. (Nothing fishy; I know the recommender and the email addresses all check out). It’s only a two course appointment (1 per semester) with the possibility for the appointment to be extended. The subject matter is somewhat in my wheelhouse; perhaps a mix of imposter syndrome and a mix of being slightly rusty with tools makes me a bit uneasy (but I think I can pick up the tools again quickly enough if I’m thrown into the fire). And it’s an urgent hire, so I interview sometime early next week to begin teaching in late August.

And now I’m really stressed out and unsure whether or not this is a good idea. As the title mentions, I’m not yet even ABD, and am concerned that this gig might take away too much time from my research. I also don’t really have a passion for teaching. I’ve done it several times before (and I know I’m good at it!) and will probably do it several times again, but honestly all the course prep-work and student interaction required gives me a fair bit of anxiety.

As it stands now, in my PhD program, I’m a researcher rather than a TA, and would maintain my research position while also teaching at this other school; two jobs to balance on top of my academic requirements. And I’m torn between desperately wanting any kind of future job security (assuming this contract gets extended) and wanting to find anything to do outside of academia.

My plan at the moment is to do the interview. If they offer me the position, see how much it pays. I don’t know what my pay threshold is at the moment, but I think I’ll feel it when I hear a number offered. If it’s scraps (which I anticipate that it might be, given that it’s only two courses), decline. And if they don’t offer me the position, well, even easier.

88,What would be my options if they decide to publish the chapter regardless?,"Hello,

Ph.D. Candidate speaking here. Last year, I was invited by another graduate student to co-author a book chapter for an edited collection with a university press. The book is led by researchers (tenured profs). At the time, I invited one of my friends/colleagues, who I have known for multiple years, closely related to the topic at hand but is not in academia, to collaborate with us on the book chapter. I did that because she kept complaining about her lack of visibility as an activist and the co-optation of her work/efforts/activism by researchers. So I heard that complaint and decided to include her. I've known that person for multiple years, so I did not think there would be a problem since this isn't the first time I had collaborated with her. 

In the meantime, my activist-friend became highly envious of me. I'm considered a ""rising star"" in my field and gained more visibility in the last couple of months. My activist-friend decided to erase my name as an author from the book chapter because she had a personal issue with me and my visibility. The other co-author (also a grad student) mentioned to her that this was not ethical. Advisors and senior profs told me that this is plagiarism because I have written sections of the book chapter and have contributed to the meetings. We had agreed beforehand that I'd be the first author because I am the only one of us three hoping to pursue a career in academia. I could not ""reason"" my activist-friend, so I spoke with the professors directing the book, and they said they would reject the book chapter. I ask them to do so (which is the best decision for me under these circumstances) because of the authorship conflict.

I am no longer in contact with my ex-friend activist. However, I recently hired a lawyer against her for defamation and harassment because she tried to sabotage other professional projects she was aware I was working on out of jealousy. She has threatened to contact all of my work collaborators to sit with them (meetings) to talk about me.  She claims I have been ""stealing her ideas,"" which is entirely false. She did have a meeting with the collaborators of a project I'm working on, but my collaborators dismissed what she said. She ended up not contacting other collaborators; she seemed to have let go because this constitutes harassment. My lawyer advised me to send a formal notice if she continues, and I won't hesitate to do so. 

I have proofs for all that happened (email conversations, screenshots) that's been written in a file on my computer. I fear that the directors of the book decided, after the peer review evaluation, to publish the chapter still despite their promise to reject the book chapter. Is this likely or unlikely to happen? And if they still decide to publish the book chapter regardless, what are my recourses in academia? This is the first time this happens to me, but I'm not too worried because I have other publications opportunities while she does not.

91,Did I blow it with potential PI?,"For some background.
I'm an MS student expecting to hand in this year. I've been approaching potential supervisors from other countries for a PhD position. I've been emailing with a short cover-letterish email, two supervisor recommendations and my cv.  I got a good response from my first choice. We've been emailing back and forth regarding particulars then he asked if i can forward him my academic transcripts in the meantime while he waits for info from a funding body to come in the next few weeks.
So I failed a lot of subjects during undergrad. A lot. For lots of reasons I don't write tests well. I never thought I had adhd or anything, I've just always known i had a learning disability. But i could never qualify for special writing conditions either. A few years pass (8 years actually), the criteria for adhd and autism evolve. During last year in lockdown while talking to a counsellor she mentioned that I actually present a lot of hallmarks for autism and adhd. I was never a disruptive or disrespectful student in class. I never missed a day of school. So i never considered this could be what's wrong with me. in any case. I do some research and decide not to go through with pursuing a formal diagnosis because I've already done the damage writing tests. I did well enough in my final year research subjects to qualify for ms. I'm otherwise a well functioning human. Seeking diagnosis is expensive and can take long in people who present ""normal behaviour"". Also there's no treatment for adults with adsd who are othereose normal.

When I sent an email replying to him, I mention this. I mention how even though I experienced a lot of failure, I am very determined and still finished my degree and did very well in subjects that weren't scored via a written exam but rather research based. In the three years before i graduated i basically worked full time in my field in assistant positions and have a lot of experience. I also mentioned my ms finishing on time despite the effects of the pandemic. We also expect at least two publications from my work. Then add the emails of my past two supervisors at the end, encouraging him to contact them should he have any concerns of my abilities.

Before all this he's been very responsive. I haven't heard from him since this email. I'm scared it comes across as me making a bunch of excuses and he simply won't reply because I seem insane. Who has autism and ""doesnt know until they're 27 years old""?

Give it to me straight. Did I scare him off and now he's ghosting me? Or does he not care and will reply when he has facts? I feel like he'd at least let me know that he's not interested but at the same time I feel like i sounded like an insane person that he won't respond to.",academia,1627576521
92,Should I Help Promote / Collect Data For Another Peer's Study That I Disagree With?,"Hello! Just to provide some context, a peer of mine is conducting a very large study and he's been trying to get me to promote it to my university's students. He's barely at 20% of the sample size he needs, and he's desperate for more participants.

However, after looking at the nature of his study, I do not feel that it is a well-designed research question, and the survey tool he has created is filled with leading questions that are biased. I don't want to talk about the specifics of the topic, but it is politically charged, and I'm afraid it's being used to fuel his own agenda.

I feel partially responsible because I was part of the group who suggested he embark on this research topic. I know I should have said something about it the first time I saw the draft, but I didn't say anything because all my other peers were so supportive of him. If I had said something in opposition then, I would've been put in a very compromised position and I figured that the study wouldn't get past the ethics board for how poorly designed it was.

I was surprised to find out it had been approved, and since then, he's been asking me to spread the study around. I've managed to avoid doing it so far, but he's getting really desperate.

96,GDPR - You Should know if you work with personal data in research,"Researchers are data collectors, and GDPR also applies to their work processes. If you are unsure how researchers meet the requirements set by GDPR while working with sensitive personal data, I wanted to write a few things you should know. 

GDPR was developed and introduced across the EU in May of 2018. The purpose of this regulation was to protect EU residents’ personal and sensitive data collected by any person and organization, including the ones outside the EU.

**What is sensitive data? Are you collecting sensitive data?** 

According to the European Commission, the following data is considered sensitive and is subject to specific processing conditions:

* Racial or ethnic origin
* Political opinions
* Religious or philosophical beliefs
* Membership of a trade union
* Health
* A person’s sex life or sexual orientation
* Genetic data
* Biometric data that is being used to uniquely identify a person.

**According to GDPR in order to collect sensitive data, there are two important points to consider:**

1. Sensitive data should be vital to your research project. If this information is not absolutely necessary for your project, then you shouldn’t be collecting it in the first place. So the researcher should follow the logic of data minimization.
2. You need to ask for “consent” prior to the interview. Consent of the interviewee is absolutely critical to even begin the interview. Consent of the interviewee means any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication to the processing of personal data relating to that person. 

**Researchers should inform individuals of five specific things:**

1. Who is processing the personal data
2. With whom that personal data may be shared
3. The purposes for which the data will be used
4. For how long it will be retained
5. What rights and privileges individuals have in terms of their personal data

A researcher can receive the consent either orally or by a written statement prior to the interview. If you opt for receiving the consent orally prior to the interview, you should record this.

**Data controller versus processor from a GDPR perspective**

The **data controller (i.e. the researcher)** possesses the largest share of responsibility when it comes to protecting the privacy and rights of the data’s subject, such as the interviewee’s name and sensitive content. They own the data and set the boundaries regarding how and why the data is controlled.

A **data processor** on the other hand is the third party that is chosen by the controller to process the data. Even though data processors are subject to less responsibility, it is very important for them to be aware of their responsibilities not to jeopardize the privacy and data security of their clients.

To put it into context, automated transcription and analysis tools act as “data processors” since they are hired or purchased by the researcher to process their data. They don’t have any rights to alter the data or transfer it with third parties unless there are special and secure clauses that allow such a transaction to take place.

**TL;DR Summary:** 

1. GDPR is relevant to researchers working with sensitive and personal data
2. GDPR was introduced into the EU in May of 2018 
3. Sensitive data is considered to specific processing conditions such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs, for example.
4. To collect sensitive data according to GDPR, the data must be vital to the project and you must have received consent
5. As a researcher, individuals should be informed about specific data processing aspects
6. There is a difference between data controllers and data processors which is significant",academia,1627547459

98,"How many hours of ""peak performance"" academic work can/do you do in a day?","Basically, if you think of yourself when you're ""laser-focused""--as ""in"" your work as you can be--how many hours can you humanly sustain that per day? I'm not asking about the marathon sessions we put ourselves through in response to a deadline or emergency, but about how many hours of really good, peak-quality (or close to it) academic work you can do before the quality/your comprehension starts to dip.

A couple of mentors have told me they usually do somewhere between 2-4 hours of this kind of work per day, mostly in the mornings, before they feel their focus and attention waning and move on to other work. This ""other work"" isn't necessarily non-academic, but might not involve peak brainpower.

I myself feel like I'm close to that 2-4 hour limit, which makes me think I need to learn how to process research more effectively. (FWIW, I'm in a heavily text-based discipline in the humanities.)",academia,1627521684
99,Fellow disabled academics- are your accommodation requests taken seriously?,"I have a disability and a medical note from my doctor asking for accommodation in remote teaching and grading. The university wants everyone in person for the fall though. I contact HR, the disability office and then the coordinator of the programs about my requests. The coordinator then says that they can try but it’s not guaranteed that my accommodations can be met (which is weird because this is how everyone did work during covid).

I realize this is a personal question but I need advice from those who walk a similar path in academia. It is not an option for me to be in-person at the university due to my disability and health issues but If I cannot perform my duties then I will lose funding and have to quit. It’s felt like a fight for accommodations since day 1 and it makes me wonder if the effort to stay is worth it sometimes. Thank you in advance.",academia,1627513595
