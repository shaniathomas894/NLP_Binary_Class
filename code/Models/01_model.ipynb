I'm designing an app about using ingredients you already have at home to reduce food waste and to reduce your carbon footprint. It will only take less than 3mins but your answers will make a huge impact on this project!\\n\\n[https://forms.gle/8T3yXPmZmEKzWSpq7](https://forms.gle/8T3yXPmZmEKzWSpq7)   \n",

       "2  Over the past few years, I've been learning a little bit about degraded lands and how to bring them back to usable land again, permaculture and food forests, also mushroom farms, and how to use mycelium to create building material for housing. \\n\\nIt really seems that there are solutions to live much better and to even help with climate change. More and more people are taking a more sustainable way of living, but if we're not in net 0 in CO2 production, then we're not much better than someone who produces more than us (at least in my opinion but I do see the other side of the argument). \\n\\nJust imagine going from a degraded land to a food-rich forest with animals and off-grid communities, where a new generation will be raised in working with the land to benefit everybody. There are plenty of permaculture and food forest communities that I came across but it's nowhere near as many we should have to change the way people live or just change the perspective on what is actually possible. Usually, it would be in the government's hands to start some big-scale projects of some sort like China did in a few cases. What would be the alternative way? How can something like this be profitable even after the initial increase of property value so that big investors can be lured in or for anyone who wants to start something like this?   \n",

I'm designing an app about using ingredients you already have at home to reduce food waste and to reduce your carbon footprint. It will only take less than 3mins but your answers will make a huge impact on this project!\\n\\n[https://forms.gle/8T3yXPmZmEKzWSpq7](https://forms.gle/8T3yXPmZmEKzWSpq7)  \n",

       "2  Self-Sustainable Communities Over the past few years, I've been learning a little bit about degraded lands and how to bring them back to usable land again, permaculture and food forests, also mushroom farms, and how to use mycelium to create building material for housing. \\n\\nIt really seems that there are solutions to live much better and to even help with climate change. More and more people are taking a more sustainable way of living, but if we're not in net 0 in CO2 production, then we're not much better than someone who produces more than us (at least in my opinion but I do see the other side of the argument). \\n\\nJust imagine going from a degraded land to a food-rich forest with animals and off-grid communities, where a new generation will be raised in working with the land to benefit everybody. There are plenty of permaculture and food forest communities that I came across but it's nowhere near as many we should have to change the way people live or just change the perspective on what is actually possible. Usually, it would be in the government's hands to start some big-scale projects of some sort like China did in a few cases. What would be the alternative way? How can something like this be profitable even after the initial increase of property value so that big investors can be lured in or for anyone who wants to start something like this?  \n",

    "In this grid search, I am using a pipeline consisting of count vectorizing which is counting how many times a word/phrase appears within the corpus and therefore binarizing the words of the corpus, and then running that through a logistic regression model. During the grid search, the model is ran multiple times trying out the different parameters provided for both the count vectorizer and the logistic regression model. Once the grid search is finished, I'm able to see what the best accuracy score was that grid searching produced, and the parameters the grid search found that produced that score.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are the exact same as the second model, but feeding it more data since X is the title _and_ the text of the post. It performs better, but the parameters that provided the best score are different. For example, binary is set to false in this model meaning this model took into account the frequncy the words showed up. This model did not perform any regularization during logistic regression which assisted in reducing the variance as seen below."

I´ve been here for 3 years, and I don't feel like I can fit with most of my peers.\\n\\nWhen I came for the first time to my department, and specifically to my lab, I met three women that were doing their Ph.D., and they were all international students. I would say that that was one of my motivations to join the lab, they seemed happy and I felt represented (even if no one was from my continent lol). Now, they are gone, and each year there are more American students in the department, and please don't get me wrong, they are great people, it´s just that we do not have anything in common, when we are together I do not speak much because I can't have an opinion in many things (like politics), or they do not have an opinion in my things, or they seem a little upset when I take my time speaking because I am not fluent yet.\\n\\nAlso, from the beginning, and not just in my department, I noticed that there exist two groups of friends: international students and Americans. Some international students join the American group, but most of them had a privileged life before coming to the US. I have spoken with some international students that also feel the same about this. Some phrases stayed in my head because I can relate to some of them. One of them said \"I feel like people here hate me\", another told me \"I am not sure, but I feel like some of them think that I am not capable of speak with them\", and another one said, \"I feel more discriminated here because I am Latina than because I am a woman\". \\n\\nI cannot avoid feeling a little rejected, and I know that no one is doing anything wrong we are just different. But every year fewer international students come (I guess covid is a reason) and the friends that I use to have are not here anymore. \\n\\nI was wondering what people think? If you are an international student have you feel this way? Have you done something that improved your relationships with your peers? Also, as a student in your native country interacting with foreign students what do you think about it?</td>\n",

       "3808  Grad international students in new country I am an international student doing my Ph.D. in the US. I´ve been here for 3 years, and I don't feel like I can fit with most of my peers.\\n\\nWhen I came for the first time to my department, and specifically to my lab, I met three women that were doing their Ph.D., and they were all international students. I would say that that was one of my motivations to join the lab, they seemed happy and I felt represented (even if no one was from my continent lol). Now, they are gone, and each year there are more American students in the department, and please don't get me wrong, they are great people, it´s just that we do not have anything in common, when we are together I do not speak much because I can't have an opinion in many things (like politics), or they do not have an opinion in my things, or they seem a little upset when I take my time speaking because I am not fluent yet.\\n\\nAlso, from the beginning, and not just in my department, I noticed that there exist two groups of friends: international students and Americans. Some international students join the American group, but most of them had a privileged life before coming to the US. I have spoken with some international students that also feel the same about this. Some phrases stayed in my head because I can relate to some of them. One of them said \"I feel like people here hate me\", another told me \"I am not sure, but I feel like some of them think that I am not capable of speak with them\", and another one said, \"I feel more discriminated here because I am Latina than because I am a woman\". \\n\\nI cannot avoid feeling a little rejected, and I know that no one is doing anything wrong we are just different. But every year fewer international students come (I guess covid is a reason) and the friends that I use to have are not here anymore. \\n\\nI was wondering what people think? If you are an international student have you feel this way? Have you done something that improved your relationships with your peers?

I was just wondering how you guys go about this? I am in Applied Linguistics/Education/TESOL and I was just wondering how other people find research and publication partners? I have worked with a few people but I am looking to branch out. I do meet people at conferences and there is the usual “we should work together soon” but then most of the time not much comes of it. I do mainly qualitative research so it’s always better to have a second person on board but I am just not quite sure how and where to approach people.\\nAny tips?   \n",

So I will occasionally get fast food via drive-thru. Well whenever they asked me if I want a receipt, I say no because in my head I'm not wasting any extra paper. Turns out, I haven't saved or achieved a singular thing by saying no. \\n\\nWhile I was waiting on my food, the window lady and got to talking and I mentioned not seeing the point of a receipt because Imma just toss it anyways so why use the paper. She then says, \"Well maybe it's for the points?\", and shows me my receipt with a barcode. \\n\\n\"So wait....a receipt is still printed even tho I said No?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yea, the computer does it on its own.

He expressed an interest in part-time volunteering role at a clean-tech organization that could leverage his skills in developing software. I’ve encouraged him to explore clean-tech as a field instead of Fintech, the field he has some internship experience. I watched this[RE: Tv show](https://www.re-tv.org/) on Prime and thought there has to be global not-for-profit organizations that could leverage his skill sets.\\n\\nI have two nieces who are also studying computer science. I am nudging them to find volunteer roles in clean-tech fields so they develop an interest and hopefully go on to work in that sectors after graduating. They however are looking to apply their CS knowledge, not just any role. For context, they are all located in Mumbai, India. Hope this post is okay. Thanks for any help and advice. \\n\\nAny ideas are greatly appreciated.   \n",

Should i tell my professor about it? If turns out that he thinks its a winning strategy to solve the problem, will he be sincere about it?

Queria uma pulseira para monitorar batimentos cardíacos/gasto calórico durante o treino e durante a natação. Além disso quero conseguir trocar músicas no Spotify. Detesto correr então acho que gps não é fundamental. Não manjo nada disso só quero algo para me incentivar um pouquinho mais nos treinos mesmo enquanto ouço minhas musiquinhas.   \n",

Turns out, I haven't saved or achieved a singular thing by saying no. \\n\\nWhile I was waiting on my food, the window lady and got to talking and I mentioned not seeing the point of a receipt because Imma just toss it anyways so why use the paper. She then says, \"Well maybe it's for the points?\", and shows me my receipt with a barcode. \\n\\n\"So wait....a receipt is still printed even tho I said No?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yea, the computer does it on its own. We gotta ask via policy but really it's just who is gonna crumble it up ya know?\"\\n\\n\"Well...this whole time I thought I was saving paper.

So I will occasionally get fast food via drive-thru. Well whenever they asked me if I want a receipt, I say no because in my head I'm not wasting any extra paper. Turns out, I haven't saved or achieved a singular thing by saying no. \\n\\nWhile I was waiting on my food, the window lady and got to talking and I mentioned not seeing the point of a receipt because Imma just toss it anyways so why use the paper. She then says, \"Well maybe it's for the points?\", and shows me my receipt with a barcode. \\n\\n\"So wait....a receipt is still printed even tho I said No?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yea, the computer does it on its own. We gotta ask via policy but really it's just who is gonna crumble it up ya know?\"\\n\\n\"Well...this whole time I thought I was saving paper.

I watched this[RE: Tv show](https://www.re-tv.org/) on Prime and thought there has to be global not-for-profit organizations that could leverage his skill sets.\\n\\nI have two nieces who are also studying computer science. I am nudging them to find volunteer roles in clean-tech fields so they develop an interest and hopefully go on to work in that sectors after graduating. They however are looking to apply their CS knowledge, not just any role. For context, they are all located in Mumbai, India. Hope this post is okay. Thanks for any help and advice. \\n\\nAny ideas are greatly appreciated.   \n",

I have an idea, as far as i know it wasnt tried before, its pretty general idea since i dont have experience in the fields my idea should be developed, what if its a very good idea? Should i tell my professor about it? If turns out that he thinks its a winning strategy to solve the problem, will he be sincere about it? What i would like to know from him is if i should invest my time on it (and maybe do my thesis on it) or if its silly   \n",
